"	"I broke and fell in Your arms in such a way
Like a leaf falls from a tree carelessly
You broke me but I finally got united with You
You took away everything of mine
I had no worries, shame or care for even a moment
In every cell of mine, there’s a desire to see You
In every cell of mine, there’s a desire to see You
It is limitless and infinite.
Today I feel love for you again
Today I feel love for you again
It is limitless and infinite.You are my carefreeness
You are my evening prayer
You are reasonlessly essential to me
You are my desire yet you are missing
And you are that quest whom1
These chain of events brought to me.
Your lips are expressing (something)
Your lips are expressing (something)
It is limitless and infinite."	
Arijit Singh	aasan nahin yahan	"Woh oh oh oh
 
Aasaan nahi yahaan aashiq ho jaana
Palkon pe kaanton ko sajaana
Aashiq ko milti hai gham ki saugaatein
Sabko naa milta yeh khazaana
 
Woh oh oh oh
 
Baaton se aage, waadon se aage
Dekho zara tum kabhi ho o..
Yeh to hai shola, yeh hai chingari
Yeh hai jawaag bhi
 
Woh oh oh oh
 
Jismon ke peechhe bhaage ho phirte
Utro kabhi rooh mein ho..
Hota kya aashiq, kya aashiqhi hai
Hogi khabar tab tumhein
 
Woh oh oh oh"	"Woh oh oh oh
 
It's not easy, over here, to fall in love
It's like aligning thorns on one's eyelashes
What lover gets out of this is just sorrows
Not everyone can explore this treasure
 
Woh oh oh oh
 
Beyond those talks, beyond those promises,
Just try to look beyond for once
It's like a flame, like fire
It's like ashes
 
Woh oh oh oh
 
You keep running behind the body
Try to go deep into the soul
Who's a lover, What's love;
Only then will you be able to know
 
Woh oh oh oh"	2
Arijit Singh	Ae Dil Hai Mushkil	"Tu safar mera
Hai tu hi meri manzil
Tere bina guzara
Ae dil hai mushkil
 
Tu mera Khuda
Tu hi dua mein shaamil
Tere bina guzara
Ae dil hai mushkil
 
Mujhe aazmaati hai teri kami
Meri har kami ko hai tu laazmi
Junoon hai mera
Banoo main tere qaabil
Tere bina guzara
Ae dil hai mushkil
 
Yeh rooh bhi meri
Yeh jism bhi mera
Utna mera nahin
Jitna hua tera
 
Tune diya hai jo
Woh dard hi sahi
Tujhse mila hai toh
Inaam hai mera
 
Mera asmaan dhoondhe teri zameen
Meri har kami ko hai tu laazmi
 
Zameen pe na sahi
Toh aasmaan mein aa mil
 
Tere bina guzara
Ae dil hai mushkil
 
Maana ki teri maujoodgi se
Ye zindagaani mehroom hai
Jeene ka koi dooja tareeka
Na mere dil ko maaloom hai
 
Tujhko main kitni
Shiddat se chaahun
Chaahe toh rehna tu bekhabar
 
Mohtaaj manzil ka toh nahin hai
Ye ek tarfa mera safar safar
Khoobsurat hai manzil se bhi
Meri har kami ko hai tu laazmi
 
Adhura ho ke bhi
Hai ishq mera qaamil
 
Tere bina guzara
Ae dil hai mushkil
 
Ek tarfa pyaar ki taakat hi kuchh aur hoti hai
Auron ke rishte ki tarah yeh do logon mein
Nahin bant ti Sirf mera haq hai iss pe
 
Ae dil hai mushkil"	"You are my journey
And you are my destination
To live without you,
O heart, is tough
 
You are my God
And you are in my prayers
To live without you,
O heart, is tough
 
Your absence tests me
For every deficit do I need you
It's my passion to become
Good enough for you
To live without you,
O heart, is tough
 
My soul is not mine
My body does not belong to me
As much as it
Belongs to you
 
Even if I have received
Only pain from you
As I have received it from you
It is a reward for me
 
My sky searches your earth
For every deficit do I need you
 
If not on earth
Meet me in the sky
 
To live without you,
O heart, is tough
 
I agree that my life is
Lacking your presence but
My heart does not know
Any other way to live
 
If you wish
You can stay unaware
Of the strength with which I love you
 
My one-sided journey
Is not dependent on destination
This journey is even more gorgeous than destination
For every deficit do I need you
 
Even though I'm incomplete
My love is complete
 
To live without you,
O heart, is tough
 
There's nothing like the power of unrequited love
Unlike other bonds, it isn't shared
It's mine, and mine alone
 
O heart, it's tough..."	3

At your service my lord,

With these seductive desirable gestures

will burn your
veil of tearful eyes
(that is, my beauty will make you forget all your sorrows )

Liquored lips have started to feel
the thirst of closeness
The amazement has driven away
the pain of separation
 
On my cheeks write down
The progress and the results of my love"

Please remember me in your prayers,
keep the taste of my name
on your tongue...
 
Keep my good deeds
in the box of your heart,
and also keep my greetings
in the letters and telegrams.
 
I have taken your darkness upon myself,
and named my bright shining star to you.
Oh my moon,
Oh my, my moon,
Oh my beloved moon..
Oh my beloved.
 
Although I'm no longer in your gatherings,
there is no sadness,
there is no sadness..
stories of ours of our closenesses,
aren't any less,
aren't any less
so many times I have turned
my mornings into evenings sitting in your presence.
 
Oh my moon,
Oh my, my moon,
Oh my beloved moon..
Oh my beloved.
 
I'm turning away from your path and leaving,
Just like the sandalwood, leaving my fragrance with you...
Leaving my heart's desire under your pillow.
covering myself in a simple cotton cloth as I take my leave."	2

Why do you keep staring out of the window; come out in the open.
 
Oh Bride! Your fantastic style rules the social media.
She holds the phone in her left hand, while there is mehendi (paste to make colorful designs on the body) on her right hand.
 
You dont care about your boyfriends and bid them goodbye on the very first date;
Poor boyfriends dip into sadness and you smile with an innocent face
Cutiepie...
 
With red ribbon tying your hair and twisting your waist,
You put everyone's heart in a critical condition.
You arouse feelings in the heart and kill with a glimpse of your tattoo.
 
There is no other Punjabi (belonging to Punjab state of India) girl in the village, like you,
Why do you keep staring out of the window; come out in the open.
 
You wear fragrance/ perfume at parties, a way to lure the guys,
This is your usual way.
You wear fragrance/ perfume at parties, a way to lure the guys,
This is your usual way.
 
You put the mind and soul into a rythm,
And play the flute without touching it.
Its fine to make guys loose their sleep,
But why don't you spare the old folks?
 
You dont care about your boyfriends and bid them goodbye on the very first date;
Poor boyfriends dip into sadness and you smile with an innocent face

My heart keeps asking me this every moment
Why am I so faithful to You?1
Why my desire for You is greater than any other wish of mine?
Why do my lips utter only Your name?
Why do I have deep yearning/passion to become Your partner
I want to drink every single teardrop of Yours and give away all my comfort(for You)
I desire You every single day, I gaze upon Your path all the time
I want to keep You safe in my arms
 
I talk only about You now
You’ve had such an effect upon me
I don’t need any advice or instruction (from anyone)
My soul has selected You
Why do I have deep yearning to become Your partner?
I want to drink every single teardrop of Yours and give away all my comfort
I desire You every single day, I gaze upon Your path all the time
I want to keep You safe in my arms
 
My heart is worried without any reason
May someone come and calm it
To sacrifice oneself in it, is a custom of love
If there’s a quality of patience in it, then it isn’t true love
O my heart! Please make me understand this mystery
Why do I have deep yearning to become Your partner?
I want to drink every single teardrop of Yours and give away all my comfort
I desire You every single day, I gaze upon Your path all the time
I want to keep You safe in my arms
 
Ae Yeah… Nae Yeah… Ae Eah Yeah…

Now that you share my pain,
Every pain is beautiful,
Now that you share my pain..
 
Your smiles are my strength,
I got hope from them only.
Whatever atrocity the world does to me,
in them [these smiles] is my safety..
My life became very beautiful,
now where else would heaven be..
 
Now that you share my pain
Now that you share my pain
Every pain is beautiful,
Now that you share my pain..
 
My life is from your heartbeats,
your wishes are my prayers now..
what a unique bond it is,
that your and my life have become one..
I'll come back to you only..
It's my promise, even if I die..

nights like some tunnel..
I don't know why on rebel flights only,
O God, my heart comes..
O God, my heart is interested..
 
There is a question about tomorrow,
[as in, no one knows what happens tomorrow]
Living life is now.
I don't know why in nomadic ways only
I find my heart interested, O Lord,
my heart is interested..
 
My philosophy is - my bag is on my shoulders.
I go wherever the path takes me..
Not on the drops,
But the sea of drops itself..
 
O God, O God.. O God.."	1

Do dil sa ik seene mein hain
Jaise Main aur Tum
Ab dono hum ik jeene mein hain
Jaise Main aur Tum
 
Jaan se zyaada chaha tumko piya re
Har pal, har dum
Hum dum tumko jiyaa re

What sort of liking of heart is this? You have become a verse of my soul Both of us were a bit empty Now both of us are a bit filled

Today I am saying it clearly It’s a small thing I love you

I do not give my life for you without any reason It’s a small thing I love you

Sunlight does not feel necessary Shade does not feel necessary Love meets on earth Now only two names are necessary Mine and yours

We shall have a God We shall create a world for ourselves We shall live this life You and me 

I and you are here, what else do I ask of God? Should I give my heart or life? Tell me what do I give? Our relationship is delicate that breath

There has never been, nor will be anyone like us It’s like two hearts in a single chest You and me

It’s like we both are one life You and me

I love you more than life, beloved Every moment I have lived you

It will be an act of benevolence if the heart promises
To tell me what it hasn’t ever said
I’m Yours in the same manner as You are mine
I’m Yours in the same manner as You are mine
 
If we keep on meeting in this way
May the evil eye of love not see us
O deceiving/cheating heart! Why have You stopped beating
After having such wayward thoughts
 
Now it is not under my control
As the heart has come and stopped on You
I’m Yours in the same manner as You are mine
I’m Yours in the same manner as You are mine
As You are mine
Hey… Oo… Ee… Na Na… Yeah…
Mehar, Mehar, Meherbani Ho
 
It will be an act of benevolence
 
I complain and then I remember
I think about You again and again
There isn’t any love, yet why do I still desire
That You always be around me
 
There’s nothing, still there’s something
After meeting You, the heart feels
I’m Yours in the same manner as You are mine
I’m Yours in the same manner as You are mine
As You are mine
As You are mine
As You are mine
As You are mine
 
It will be an act of benevolence

this world is, as if mute..
 
Where to find moments of joy,
Even time is like without a sign..
 
There are complaints on so many lips, there are many distances from the life.. Why do the dreams dampen in eyes, when the line leaves these hands, for no reason.
 
The wish I had sent,
that collided with the sky such that a call has come back..
 
where have the breaths turned their face,
I don't see any path..
where has the heartbeat left the heart,
and where have these bodies left (their) shadows
 
I, here, think this again and again..
a smoke of memories is walking with me.
 
The wish I had sent,
that collided with the sky such that a call has come back.."	2

Let some part of me belong to you
Look deep into my inner self and realise
Who I really am
 
You never used to upset me
Why am I left om my own now?
The moments of love we've been through
Implied you were mine
Then why have you changed so much?
Why is it so?

there is a half-baked promise of laughing n crying..
look at it with a squinted angle..
these moments, let me get drenched in the river of these moments,
these eyes, let me learn the silent language of these eyes..
yeah, let me learn..
unsaid talks,
unheard wishes..
without saying or hearing, we talked what we had to..
 
there be a slightly dark complexioned night,
and there be closeness of silence,
without saying, without hearing, there be talk between us."

Oh..

It doesn't matter if you leave
Just let this love of ours live long1
 
Doesn't matter if the earth and the sky
Remain fine or not
Just let this love of ours live long
 
Oh o.. mm..
 
I'm afraid of losing you
If I find God, I'll ask him
""What do I do with this life
Tell me""
 
Oh..
Now that you are with me
I'm not thirsty anymore
My prayers have been heard
 
Doesn't matter if I-
-Stay alive or not
Let this love of ours live long

I will hold you to my chest, hidden from everyone,
I will cross all limits, immersed in your love,
This is the first time I have loved someone so much.
 
Your wet lips are telling me something,
My heart is happy that our thoughts are the same,
Don't stop yourself now, listen to your heart,
Let the evening turn into night,
This moment is so beautiful,
I have stolen it from destiny.
 
Don't leave tonight, the rainy season is here,
The season for you and I to meet is here,
I will hold you to my chest, hidden from everyone,
I will cross all limits, immersed in your love,

Arijit Singh	Breakup Song	"Breakup song, breakup song
Badhte chalte
Feel it strong

Party chaal in the club
Breakup song breakup song

Tick tick tick..
(breakup song.. Breakup song….)

Angrezi chidiya ki khaatir
Desi dil mera tod diya
Maine chhod diya
Usey chhod diya
Uski kaali kartooton ne
Uska bhaanda phod diya
Maine chhod diya
Usey chhod diya

Dil pe pathar rakhke
Muh pe makeup kar liya

Oh dil pe pathar rakhke
Muh pe makeup kar liya

Mere saiyaan ji se aaj
Maine breakup kar liya (Repeat once)

Subah savere uthke
Maine ye sab kar liya

Mere saiyaan ji se aaj
Maine breakup kar liya

Humko bin bataye
Tune yeh kab kar liya

Arey humko bin bataye
Tune yeh kab kar liya

Tere saiyaan ji se kahe
Tune breakup kar liya (Repeat once)

Subah savere uthke
Maine ye sab kar liya

Tere saiyaan ji se kahe
Tune breakup kar liya

Breakup song.. Breakup song….

Kuch din to rona dhona
Bumper kiya
Aur phir delete uska
Number kiya

Aansu jo sookhe seedha
Parlour gayi
Parlour mein jaake
Shampoo jamkar kiya

College ki saheliyon se
Catch-up kar liya
Arey college ki saheliyon se
Catch-up kar liya
Jinko mill na paayi unko
Whatsapp kar diya

Mere saiyyan ji se aaj
Maine breakup kar liya
Subah savere uth ke
Maine ye sab kar liya
Mere saiyyan ji se aaj
Maine breakup kar liya

Look look, look baby
Mujhe lagta hai
Jo bhi tune kiya hai
Woh very very right hai

Bhootkaal ko bhool jaa ab tu
Aane wala future
Very very bright hai

Main hoon na baby
Saath tere, haan
Party sharty honi
Poori night hai

Mind na kar naa
Thoda zyada bol doon
Kyunki banda
Very very tight hai

Usse phone mila
Aur gaali de
Photo jalake kar de raakh
Saale teri maa ki aankh

Guilty hu ab jo saiyan
Stupid tera
Jeevit hua hai
Phir se kyun cut kara

Awsy relationship ka
Label hata
Duniya ko tu hai
Available bata

Mere soye armaano
Ko wake up kar diya

Arey mere soye armaano
Ko wake up kar diya

Jo tere saiyaan ji se (ahah..)
Tune breakup kar liya

Tere saiyaan ji se kahe tune..

Tere saiyaan ji se kahe
Tune breakup kar liya (Repeat once)

For the sake of the English bird
The country broke my heart
Left me
They left me
Left him
His black deeds
Broke his wallet
They left me
Left him
 
With a heavy heart
I did my makeup
Oh with a heavy heart
I did my makeup
I broke up with my beloved today
I broke up with my beloved today
I did all of this when I woke up in the morning
I broke up with my beloved today
 
When did you do all of this without telling me?
Hey, when did you do all of this without telling me?
You broke up with your beloved today
You broke up with your beloved today
 
I did all of this when I woke up in the morning
I broke up with my beloved today
 
Ba ba.. breakup song
 
I cried for a few days
Then I deleted his number
The tears dried, then I went straight to the parlour
I went to the parlour and shampooed fiercely
 
I caught up with my college friends
Hey, I caught up with my college friends
When I did not find them, I whatsapped them
 
I broke up with my beloved today
I did all of this when I woke up in the morning
I broke up with my beloved today
 
[King]
Look baby, I think that whatever you did was very, very right
Forget the past, the future coming is very, very bright
 
I am with you, baby
We have all night to party
Don't mind me if I talk too much
Because I am drunk
 
Ring his phone and give him abuse
Burn the photo and keep it
And call him an ass
 
The moment your beloved left you,
the cupid within you surfaced
Remove the old relationship label
and tell the world that you are available
 
You woke up my slumberous desires
Hey, you woke up my slumberous desires
 
With your beloved today
Oh. you broke up with your beloved today
You broke up with your beloved today

If I've made a deal with love, there's no need to be anxious about it
You will have to come to me
Fulfill the promise that was made
 
As long as this moon and the stars twinkle
Our bond will not break
I will have to come
Fulfill the promise that was made
 
Our story written with your words
Will be recited by the world forever
Whatever punishment the world may give us
I will come to you
Fulfill the promise that was made
 
The world always tells me
No one returns back here
Let the world see this is untrue
You will have to come to me
Fulfill the promise that was made
 
I've attached much of the world to myself
I've spent my time making excuses
My heart has not found peace since being away from you
You will have to come
Fulfill the promise that was made
 
I've always come and I'll keep coming
I'll keep fulfilling the rituals of love
My love if you've given me forever then I need no other provisions
You'll have to come
Fulfill the promise that was made"	1

this defect that love is, this enmity of love,
Love, love, love..
I have had such an enmity with you,
That I haven't remained like myself anymore..
My name is love, your name is love,
My name, your name, my name, it's all love..
Should I change my name,
or should I hide your name?
Or should I just leave all the memories
and become a hermit?
So that there is just one work, love, for me,
My work be love, love be my work..
I wish to clinch this dark night,
and hold this cold moon..
I wish to change the way there is a difference
between the day and the night..

But still my heart had the thought
that now that we've been meeting
maybe I should ask you at least once
 
I'd like for you to tell me
Should I love or not?
Give me the directions to your heart
Should I love or not?
 
I've never had wishes like this before
Oh, to meet someone else
I had never made the effort
Untangle my problems
Should I love or not?
say it to my eyes with your own
Should I love or not?
 
I have small dreams
My dreams have songs
The songs have within them life
they have longing and love.
I don't see dreams anymore
which don't have you in it
I've opened these lips
which were closed til now
 
More than I have in myself
this heart has for you
so much trust.
In my lonely moments
I weave dreams of you
I've fallen in love with you.
I'll never ask you
Should I love or not?
In your dreams, I now want to live
Why would I not want to love!
 
I'd like for you to tell me
Should I love or not?
Give me the directions to your heart
Should I love or not?"	4

I lost my heart and earned love.
When she asked for a star,
I called the moon to the earth.
the one who never got away from my eyes for a moment,
got lost suddenly when I was looking.
I wonder how innocent she was,
when I saw how she transformed herself in no time.
the one who used to say we'll never be get separated,
said goodbye in no time.
There was me, her, and many evenings,
there were many moons lighting the sky.
That sea of togetherness ebbed away,
and there was just sand left in my hands.
someone ask her what mistake I made,
why she got upset with me in no time.
the one who used to be my breathe
became air in no time.
I was the reason for her living and dying,
and then I became 'without reason' in no time."	1

I pass every night up awake,
what more do I tell you..
O dear, my eyes look for you,
I sacrifice myself upon you,
Today I make true wishes (to get you)..
what more do I tell you..
I have slowly, with the thread of sleeps,
tied your dream (so that I dream of you always)
I don't want the world, nor the skies,
I just want you to be mine..
You're the way of love,
I am some immaturity..
If you attach me to yourself,

From your thoughts, to your thoughts only
I wander..

I have heard that This is the custom of loyalty The intoxication that is over my heart, It is for the first time
Sometimes like pain, sometimes pale, My life was without any name Some desires showered kindness And came forward to hold my hand
The one eye is present in my soul such that For the first time a tale was created from a single incident I have found my shelter in your arms
The words which I thought were useless, Became a necessity It’s good that some decisions of fate were made
Every moment is changed, There is an inebriation over me everywhere Love was a stranger, It is with me for the first time
I have realised this effect bow, What is this color that is over me?

After you told me how you felt,
Let me say it to you too,
That I’m in love with you.
Atif:
I’m becoming yours,
Getting lost in my thoughts,
Since I met you...
I’m becoming yours, getting lost in my thoughts,
Since I met you.
 
Some times, even before,
My heart would often think up
Dreams of love in lonely nights
 
Some times, even before,
My heart beat would hum softly,
But what i feel now, is not how it used to be.
 
Female:
What ever has happened to you,
Is also happening to me,
So let me say it to you too,
I’m in love with you.
 
Atif:
I’m becoming yours,
Getting lost in my thoughts,
Since I met you...
 
Should I touch you with my sight,
Because my arms yearn for you,
My heart has called out,
So come on now...
Look, the dewdrops fall as rain,
Even the weather drops a hint,
So come on now...
 
Female:
Arm in arm,
like an embrace,
I admit, and I agree,
I’m in love with you.
 
Atif:
I’m becoming yours,
Getting lost in my thoughts,
Since I met you..."	1

It's like a colorful spring
You are like a mad night

With you my love

If you give me one tiny signal
 
Whichever street I wander inside
I come face to face with your scent
Every night
You're the dream that I see
 
You and me meeting here, is like a rule
I'm enlightened for I'm yours
I'm like a quiet sky
and you're the moon
 
It's a blessing of God
That he let us meet
After madly falling in love with you,

With you my love
It's like a colorful spring
Without you,
I don't wanna live
 
I have left behind all the roads
And came to you
The tears in my eyes are yours
Recognize them
 
For me everything is second to you
This sentence of mine is worth a hundred normal sentences of mine
I will never leave you
Know that!
 
It's a blessing of God
That he let us meet
After madly falling in love with you,
I have learned how to live
 
With you my love

It's like a colorful spring

Yes in Your Love
 
You can't escape my love...
 
Yes it is my fault that You got this
I ask only this: Why did You Love?
Why did You Love?
Where is Love nowadays anywhere
If we spend a few moments in Love now
Then what is the whole life worth
It doesn't listen to any talk
Just believe that Life has only one meaning
Love is the only religion
If there is no Love then even the God is angry
 
I complain to You God, It's unfaithfulness again
Its difficult to get free, Yes in Your Love
I complain to You God, It's unfaithfulness again
It's difficult to get free, Yes in Your Love
 
Yes You are regardless of the world
I am also regardless, then why any veil from me
Yes if there was a veil then would any heart fall for it
I prayed for love not to happen
I prayed for love to happen, I took punishment
I have understood that this is a huge burden
I tried to stop this heart a lot, but it going once again to get cheated
This heart is broken because of its own nature
 
I complain to You God, It's unfaithfulness again
It's difficult to get free, Yes in Your Love
I complain to You God, It's unfaithfulness again
It's difficult to get free, Yes in Your Love
 
Yeah I'm coming back to the race
Tell me if you're ready!
Can you take the pace?
This time wanna make you see
Ain't nobody gonna play game like me
Undercover core like eyes... yeah
You know, You know
You loose when you call the die
Just gonna chew and make you see
Make you see...
Ain't nobody gonna run a race like me"

your signs, limitless..
There should be nothing lacking, I should be out of consciousness,
Touch me so much, so much as without limits..

feelings began to fire up again,
they began talking to me..
Coming into your arms,
Both my worlds
Began to contract.
I am lost in your arms,
you're not conscious either..
There be no morning to velvetty night,
Limitless...
Love me in such a way, without any limits..
 
Do some effrontery..
and some I do, in such a way,
that even the two shadows that we see here,
feel shy and turn their faces the other way..
 
You have touched this body
Now kiss my soul too..
Why are my words all drenched
Being all broken, being helpless,
every element says,
why are my feelings all drenched
Two unaware drenched bodies,
two impatient drenched bodies
are turning all night..
 
Limitless,
Love me without any limits..

Make her come into my arms

God, I have come to your door
leaving all the world
Make my dreams beautiful(or make them come true)
I am binding you with my heart's yearning
You have forgiven sins
after listening to prayers
It is love
that you have given to every single one
To my sighs too
Liten to my prayers
Help me get the one to whom I have given my heart
She is my hope, my thirst. Just let her know this
The one who smiles looking at me
To whom I want to make mine, day 'n night
God, assign her to me
I am binding you with my heart's yearning
I have just asked for what is mine
What do you stand to loose
I have not asked you for paradise
What kind of God are you?
You might only be a name afterall
that you can't even deliver my asking
What I need
please handover to me
May your lineage rejoice
May my love live long
Just give me my life
I am binding you with my heart’s yearning

All the days are colourless
There is immense loneliness
There is immense solitude
And I am here spending every moment without a trace of love
 
If a dream breaks in a single moment
The world seems lonely
The world seems lonely
 
When no loved one remains
The world seems lonely
The world seems lonely
 
In this world built of stones
All the faces are stony, even the hearts are made of stone
Then why do I remain lonely, and roam the streets like a destitute
You shall not attain anything here, my heart
 
If a dream breaks in a single moment
The world seems lonely
The world seems lonely
 
When no loved one remains
The world seems lonely
The world seems lonely
 
Why does this happen
When this heart cries out
Even the wind seems as if it is crying?
 
The world seems lonely
If a dream breaks in a single moment
The world seems lonely
The world seems lonely
 
When no loved one remains
The world seems lonely
The world seems lonely
Seems lonely"	2
Rahat Fateh Ali Khan	Main Jahaan Rahoon	"Main jahaan rahoon main kahin bhi hoon
teri yaad saaath hai
main jahaan rahoon main kahin bhi hoon
teri yaad saaath hai
kisi se kahoon ke nahi kahoon
ye jo dil ki baat hai
 
Kehne ko saath apne ek duniya chalti hai
per chhup ke is dil mein tanhaai palti hai
bas yaad saath hai
teri yaad saath hai
teri yaad saath hai

main jahaan rahoon main kahin bhi hoon

Kahin to dil mein yaadon ki ek sooli gad jaati hai
kahin har ek tasveer bahut hi dhundhli pad jaati hai
koi nai duniya ke naye rangon mein khush rehta hai
koi sab kuchh paa ke bhi ye man hi man kehta hai
kehne ko saath apne ek duniya chalti hai
per chhup ke is dil mein tanhaai palti hai
Bas yaad saath hai
teri yaad saath hai
teri yaad saath hai
teri yaad saath hai
 
Kahin to beete kal ki jade dil mein hi utar jaati hain
kahin jo dhaage toote to malaayein bhikar jaati hain
koi dil mein jagah nayi baaton ke liye rakhta hai
koi apni palkon par yaadon ke diye rakhta hai
kehne ko saath apne ek duniya chalti hai
per chhup ke is dil mein tanhaai palti hai
 
Bas yaad saath hai
teri yaad saaath hai
teri yaad saaath hai
teri yaad saaath hai"	"Wherever I live, Wherever I am
Your memory is with me
Wherever I live, Wherever I am
Your memory is with me
Should I tell it to someone or not?
What is in my heart
 
Though it looks like the whole world moves with me
But hidden in this heart grows loneliness
Only the memory is with me
Your memory is with me
Your memory is with me
Your memory is with me
Wherever I live, Wherever I am
Your memory is with me
 
Somewhere a stake of memories penentrates the heart
Somewhere every picture gets blurred
Someone lives happily in the new colors of the new world
Someone keeps saying ""me, me"" even after getting everything
Though it looks like the whole world moves with me
But hidden in this heart grows loneliness
Only the memory is with me
Your memory is with me
Your memory is with me
Your memory is with me
 
Somewhere the roots of yesterday penetrate the heart
Somewhere garlands get disarrayed when the thread breaks
Someone keeps a place in his heart for new things
Someone places candles of memories on his eyelashes
Though it looks like the whole world moves with me
But hidden in this heart grows loneliness
 
Only the memory is with me
Your memory is with me
Your memory is with me
Your memory is with me"	2

The glances are telling, the world knows.
The story of my heart, oh, the story of my heart.
Love prays, love wishes for a hurricane (to stir the life within).
 
A story of love, a feeling till now unknown to me slowly walks in.
The first tender promise you gave was to be forever as one.

And filled it with love
 
Someone let loose my heart
And filled it with love
Just with his eyes, he spoke of a thousand things
And I have fallen for him now
He left me lovelorn, craving for him
And I have fallen for him now
He left me lovelorn, craving for him
 
Now the heart desires what's on the lips of this silence
I’d write a list of lovely words
May she write a few of her moments to my name, and so will I do the same
And write many a rendezvous, too
In the first sight, she took my breath away
And her eyes are embossed on this heart of mine
Where’d I go now, the heart stops at her’s
Where she saw me and went ahead on her way
And I have fallen for him now
He left me lovelorn, craving for him
And I have fallen for him now
He left me lovelorn, craving for him
 
The free birds of weather are in her hands
Or is she the breezes herself
Like the sunny days in a winter, she’s the warm evening
She’s like those first rains
She’s the weather of my love, she’s my God as well
She’s the weather of my love, she’s my God as well
Oh, what is all in her eyes did I end up reading
And I have fallen for him now
He left me lovelorn, craving for him
And I have fallen for him now
He left me lovelorn, craving for him
 
Someone let loose my heart
And filled it with love
Just with his eyes, he spoke of a thousand things

Love takes you closer to God
 
Quench my thirst with your eyes

Embellish my dreams

Quench my thirst with your eyes, embellish my dreams
My lips speak what your heart says….

Whatever was there
is still here today
I too am standing here
only you are absent.
Beloved, if you were going to break my heart
tell me why you loved in the first place?
Beloved, just come here once.
 
There's sunlight above for miles
there's no shade in the way.
I roam over scorching sand
in your desire.
Why did the waves
bring my broken dreams ashore?
Now I pray to the Lord
to return the right of my love.
Beloved, if you were going to break my heart
tell me why you loved in the first place?
Beloved, come here once.
beloved..
 
There was a doll made of glass
she loved a heart of stone
she broke in such a manner
there was no control over the hands
My heart looks for you
where we had made promises
where I had bowed in front of you
I am still alone there.
Beloved, if you were going to break my heart
tell me why you loved in the first place?
Beloved, come here once.

Which I never thought I would,because it was at a distance of many miles
Oh God why did you show me such dreams?
When in fact it was to be broken?
 
In one second we both were together,though it was meant only for one second
Yours and mine,mine and yours love story is difficult
It cannot be described in two words
 
Every second of our conversation was the most colorful of all
It cannot be described in two words

It cannot be described in two words

Because of my care for you,every second I am suffering
I am suffering,let the distance
And all the other things standing between us vanish

Every second of our conversation made me unaware of the surroundings
It cannot be described in two words
In every feeling you are there,in every memory I desire for you

There was a Heer and there was a Ranjha*
It is said in my village
If the heart is true,
Even if there are a hundred hurdles,
The destiny will bow to the feet,
Ho ho
The side of Your robe, oh God,
has become the sky
Now it has no directions
[Towards you, towards you, towards you, oh God,
Towards you, towards you, towards you..] x2
The heart is lost,
It has become someone's,
Now the path has been found
of happiness
There is a dream in the eyes
for someone
Now the path has been found
of happiness
Oh God the new relationship,
is touching the heart
Some string is pulling me, towards you

Towards you, towards you, towards you..] x2"	1

Your breaths go one by one.
Whenever I sigh somewhere,
I just wish to see you for a moment.

Waits for you.
Wherever you go,
You come back to my heart.
Particle by particle, my sorrow
Smiles in your heart,
Wherever you go,
You live in my heart."

As the moon is incomplete without a sky to adorn
Take your place within my heart
Only then will this companionship be complete
 
Your love has given me fame
I have shattered in your arms
 
I see in the dawns and dusks
Your face
I see in the sunlight and in the shadows
Your face
 
Glimpse into your heart
And you shall find our love
Ask not the state of my anguish
I cannot spend moment now without you
 
In all my embraces and on all my paths
I see your face
Everytime I sigh, wherever I seek refuge
I see your face"	1

Tune jab aakhiri khat mera jalaya... hoga
Tune jab phool, kitabon se nikaale honge
Dene waala bhi tujhe yaad toh aaya hoga
 
Teri aankhon ke dariya ka

Bichadna bhi zaroori tha
Zuroori tha ki
Hum dono tawaaf-e-aarzoo karte
Magar phir aarzu'on ka
bikharna bhi zaroori tha
Teri aankhon ke dariya ka
utarna bhi zaroori tha
 
Bataao yaad hai tumko
Woh jab dil ko churaya tha
Churaai cheez ko tumne
Khuda ka ghar banaya tha
Woh jab kehte thhe
Mera naam tum tasbih mein padhte ho
Mohabbat ki Namaazo ko
qara karne se darte ho
Magar ab yaad aata hai
Woh baatein thi mahaz baatein
Kahin baaton hi baaton mein
Mukarna bhi zaroori tha
Teri aankhon ke dariya ka
Utarna bhi zaroori tha
 
Wahi hai sooratein apni
Wahi main hoon, wahi tum ho
Magar khoya huaa hoon main
Magar tum bhi kahin gum ho
Mohabbat mein dagha ki thi
So kaafir the so kaafir hain
Mili hain manzilein phir bhi
Musaafir thhe, musaafir hain
Tere dil ke nikaale hum
Kahaan bhatke, kahaan pahunche
Magar bhatke toh yaad aaya
Bhatakna bhi zaroori tha
Mohabbat bhi zaroori thi
Bichhadna bhi zaroori tha
Zaroori tha ki

Magar phir aarzu'on ka
Bikharna bhi zaroori tha

Utarna bhi zaroori tha"	"Many a word would have hugged your feet
When you burned the last letter from me
When you took the flowers out of the books,
You must have remembered who gave them to you
 
It was necessary
For the river of your eyes to flow
It was necessary to love
As well as separate
It was necessary
That we completed our desires
But it was also necessary
For them to spill
It was necessary
For the river of your eyes to flow
 
Tell me you remember
When you had stolen my heart
You had made that stolen item
The home of God
When you used to say
That you read my name in prayers
You feared missing
The prayer of love
But now I remember it and know
That they were mere talks
It was necessary to go back
On your words
It was necessary
For the river of your eyes to flow
 
Our faces are the same,
You are the same and so am I
But I am lost somewhere,
So are you
We have been disloyal in love,
We were and are non-believers
We have attained our destinations
But still are travellers
I wandered a lot after being cast
Out from your heart
But when I wandered I realized
That to wander was also necessary
It was necessary to love
As well as separate it was necessary
It was necessary
That we completed our desires
But it was also necessary
For them to spill
It was necessary
For the river of your eyes to flow"	2

Just now life has started,
Don't talk about stop-walking now.
 
I've lost myself, o sweetheart.
Closing my eyes, i'm seeking dreams.
 
May my love rest in your arms.
May your heartbeats listen to my heartbeats.
My desires are free from your desires.
Your tossing and turnings describe my story.
What a relief! What a passion, o sweetheart!
 
Just now we've started to listen to our hearts,
Don't talk about the world now.
Just now the silence has come,
Don't talk about restart-talking now.
Just now we've started wandering,
Don't talk about being normal now.
Just now life has started,
Don't talk about stop-walking now.

Which comes after the night not spent with you."	4

You moved ahead of me (i.e. left me behind), but you were just here
Didn't listen to anything, (how long were you upset), how could you say farewell?
Between whom my life had existed until yesterday...
To those arms, those cool shadows, I too say farewell
Farewell to my ways (my paths), my breath says farewell
Farewell, now what's left to say, when you've already said farewell
Listen, oh unconcerned one, you can leave today and turn your eyes away
But your gaze will search for me everywhere
During nights, when you turn sides [i.e. because you can't sleep] you will remember me
Then you'll know your mistake and ask yourself, why did I say farewell
Farewell, could someone ask her, what she thought when she said farewell
Farewell, now what's left to say, when you've already said farewell

I was happy-go-lucky, but yet my heart wishes (for you)
That if you were with me today, every path would have blossomed
I'm upset at you, I'm mad at you, my heart is confused
You didn't think clearly, you didn't listen to reason, why did you say farewell
Farewell, could someone ask her, what she thought when she said farewell
Farewell, now what's left to say, when you've already said farewell"	3

Oo..."	"Beloved, how do you cause this trouble?
Trumpet blows in my heart
Sun goes down,
I come after you as soon as night falls
 
You threw a net over Commando,
Neither black magic nor black money will work Ra!
Your lover is not afraid of war
But try at least once with love
 
Tell me,
what’s in idle talk?
Fall in love Make promises
for a moment or two
 
My heart is without heartbeat
Touch it and make it beat
Give me some relief
and some torment
 
My lonely arms,
You know I need you
My eyes are saying
You know I want you
Forget the world and
Come and sing this song

Let there be no delay in meeting
Let me do some wrongdoing
Boy I need you, come a little close
 
We won’t have these nights again
Let us stay together till the morning
Let us talk what’s in our hearts
 
My lonely arms,
You know I need you
My eyes are saying
You know I want you
Forget the world and
Come and sing this song

Hua Hai Aaj Pehli Bar"	"Hua hai aaj pehli baar
jo aise muskuraya hoon
tumhe dekha to jaana ye
ke kyun duniya mein aaya hoon
 
ye jaan lekar ke jaan meri
tumhe jeene main aaya hoon
main tumse ishq karne ki
ijaazat rab se laaya hoon
 
zameen se aasmaan tak
hum DhoonDh aaye jahaan saara
bana paaya nahi ab tak
khuda tumse koi pyaara
 
baaton mein teri hain badmashiyaan
sab bewajah ki hain taareefiyaan
 
main likh doon aasmaan par ye

hua na hoga ab koi

tere sajde mein laaya hoon
main tumse ishq karne ki
ijaazat rab se laaya hoon
 
tu hai jo roobaroo mere
bada mehfooz rehta hoon
tere milne ka shukraana
khuda se roz karta hoon
 
humko pata hai ye naadaaniyaan hain
aawara dil ki hai aawaariyan
 
ye dil paagal bana baiTha
ise ab tu hi samjha de
dikhe tujhme meri duniya
meri duniya tu ban ja re
 
hoon khushkismat jo kismat se
tumhe aise main paaya hoon
main tumse ishq karne ki
ijaazat rab se laaya hoon"	"it’s happened for the first time,
that I have smile like this.
when I saw you I learnt
why I have come to the world.
 
With this life, O my life,
I have come to live you.
I have brought the permission to love you
from God.
 
from the earth to the sky,
I have searched the whole world.
God has not yet been able to make
someone as pretty as you.
 
in your talks, there are mischiefs
all the praises are for nothing.
 
I’ll write this on the sky,
and the entire world will read
that no one has been or will be
like the two of us are.
 
I have brought the praises of the entire world
to pray to you.
I have brought with me the permission
to love you, from God.
 
now that you are in front of me,
I am very safe.
I thank God every day,
for meeting you.
 
I know these are naiveties
they are the vagrancies of the vagrant heart.
 
this heart has become mad for you,
now you only explain to it.
I see my world in you,
now you only become my world.
 
I am lucky that I have got you
like this from the fate.
I have brought the permission to love you
from God."	1

Udit Narayan	Gun Gun Guna	"Gun gun guna re, gun gun guna re,

Ho maayoosion ke chonge utaar ke phenk de na saare
Candle yeh shaam ka phoonk raat ka cake kaat pyaare

Dumdaar nuskha yaar humne jo aazmaya re
Aansuon ko chooran chaba ke humne dakaar maara re

Hain, sar pe tere uljhanon ke jo ye tokre

Jo teri neendein apne naakhoon se noch le

Zindagi ke raashan mein, gham ka quota zyada hai
Black mein khareedenge khushi ka pitaara re
 
Gun gun guna re, gun gun guna re,
gun gun guna yeh gaana re
 
Tu, munh phulaa de to ye sooraj bhi dhalne lage
Arrey tu muskura de, chand ka bulb jalne lage
Tu chup rahe toh maano behri lage zindagi
Tu bol de toh parde kaano ke khulne lage
Ek band botal ke, jaisa kaahe baitha hai
Khaali dil se bhar de na, glass yeh hamara re
 
Gun gun guna re, gun gun guna re,
gun gun guna yeh gaana re
 
Ho.. bindas hoke har gham ko yaar khoonti pe taang dunga
Thoda udhaar main itminaan tumse hi maang lunga
Hai seekha hai maine yaar jo tumne sikhaaya re
Dumdaar nuska yaar maine bhi aazmaaya re
Aasuon ka chooran chaba ke maine dakaar maara re"	"hum, hum this song,

remove and throw away all the robes of of disappointment,
blow away the candle of evening and cut the cake of night,
you didn't learn but we taught you,
as we tried this strong recipe
we chewed the chooran (digestive powder) and burped..
 
hum, hum this song,
hum, hum this song...
 
the baskets of problems that are there on your head,
give them to us, you become light-headed o boy,
all those pains that pinch away your sleep with their nails,
push them into a burning stove..
in the ration of life, the quota of sadness is more
we'll buy in black the box of joy..
 
hum, hum this song,
hum, hum this song...
 
if you become angry, this sun begins to set,
if you smile, the bulb of moon gets on,
if you are silent, the life seems deaf,
if you speak, the curtains of ears open up,
why are you sitting like a closed bottle,
fill this glass of ours with this heart alone..
 
hum, hum this song,
hum, hum this song...
 
I'll be carefree and hang every sorrow on a spike,
a little patience I'd borrow from you only..
I have learnt what you have taught me,
as I too have tried this strong recipe
we chewed the chooran and burped.."	4

I'm still confident that he loves me

Strange girl she is, whenever she meets keeps blushing
Sometimes nervously hides her face behind her hairs
Strange boy he is, bumping into me, he passes by
It may be a fun to him to tease me
To annoy me, he looks into others' eyes
Neither he denies nor he expresses
I'm still confident that he loves me
Neither she denies nor she expresses
 
When I am there, she is innocent and completely unknown
But when I'm not there, she thinks of me
He keeps peeking on me everyday
But when he comes in front of me, he becomes unknown
Without my permission she stares at me
Neither she denies nor she expresses
I'm still confident that she loves me
Neither he denies nor he expresses
I'm still confident that he loves me"	1

You met my gaze and wiped me out
My poor heart got wounded
I got to know of your admirers
They are a bunch of them
 
Make me your moon (boyfriend)
Glow the star of my destiny
 
One look doesn't please me
So look at me another time
Tan tana tan tan tara (melodic chorus)
Tan tana tan tan tara
Wanna go for the 9 to 12 show?

Hey tan tana tan tan tan tara
Tan tana tan tan tan tara
Wanna go for the late night show?
I've heard of your admirers
They are everywhere you go
 
So what are you thinking about
Let's go disappear

Wanna go for the late night show
 
Your gaze almost killed me
My heart got wounded though
Wanna go for the 9 to 12 show?

Neha Kakkar	Sawan Aaya Hai	"Humko yeh batao
Door kaise tum rehte ho
Kaise judaai ka
Gham yaara tum sehte ho
 
Hum tanha mar jayenge
Yaara teri yaad mein
Dekho bheege hai kitna
Ashqon ki barsat mein
 
Zakham dikhaun kaise dil ke mere
Logo ne kitna sataya hai
 
Mujhe na aur rulana tu
Sawan aaya hai
Mere na dardon ko mitana tu
Sawan aaya hai
 
Sabse chhupa ke tujhe sene se lagana hai
Pyar me tere had se guzar jana hai
Itna pyaar kisi pe pehli baar aaya hai
 
Mohabbat barsa dena tu
Sawan aaya hai…
 
Dil yeh dhadakta hai
Tere dil ke hi dhadakne se
Hum bhi tadapte hai
Yaar tere hi thadapne se
 
Ishq main dooba dooba hun
Mujhko na ab hosh hai
Yaar ishq ki zameen pe
Ab asman behosh hai
 
Kaise dikhaun ab junoon ye mera
Tere ishq ne pagal banaya hai
 
Dil nahi aur dukhana tu
Sawan aaya hai
Tere bhi zakham dikhana tu
Sawan aaya hai
 
Tumse door rehna
Ek saza hai majburi hai
Meri zindagi toh
Yaar tere bin adhuri hai
 
Log toh kya kya kehte hai
Dil seh seh ke rota hai
Kaise tumko bataun
Mere sath sanam kya hota hai
 
Apne paraye hone lage hain
Jab se tumko apna banaya hai
 
Hamesha saath nibhana tu
Sawan aaya hai
Tere aur mere milne ka
Mausam aaya hai"	"Tell us
How far do you live
How separation
Gam Boy you're Sehte
 
We will die sequestered
Yara in your memories
Look how wet
Ashkon in rain
 
I will show how the heart Zkhm
People are much persecuted
 
I do not and you cry
Sawan has come
You my not erase pains
Sawan has come
 
You have to find the most hidden from hatching
You have to go through much in love
The first came on a love
 
Tu Mohabbat give rain
Sawan aaya hai ...
 
It is heart Ddakta
Thine heart from the Ddakne
We also have Tdapte
Man of thy Tdapane
 
I dipped dipped in Ishk
Now is not me conscious
Man on Zmin of Ishk
Now uneven unconscious
 
Now it will show how my obsession
Crazy made your Ishk
 
Heart and you Dukna
Sawan has come
You also show your Zkhm
Sawan has come
 
Stay away from you
A punishment is Mzburi
I urge Zindgi
Man is incomplete without you
 
So what do people say
Hsieh Hsieh heart cries
How do I tell thee
What happens with me sanam
 
Have started their own,
When you have built yourself
 
Always carry with you
Sawan has come
You meet me

Oh my love, our love is true,
But fate demands something else.
Oh my love, my love,
My love, my love...
 
It is the blessing of time that you
Are sitting here beside me.
I have so much love for you...
How could I possibly put it in mere words?
 
Just once, let your sight turn towards me
With whom can I go and share the din in my heart?
 
Oh my love, you're my (one) true love...
But fate demands something else.
 
In the face of our fate, what can we do?
In the face of our fate, what can we do?
In the face of our fate, oh what can we do?

There's no one like you in the whole world
You are the beginning of the time
You destroy when you open your eyes
 
Abeyance erupts,
Say Har Har Har,
(All the three har's have different meanings
first one means ""to captivate""
second one means ""to consolidate""
third one means ""to destroy"")
 
(Lyricist define Lord Shiva as)
 
he can never be created nor destroyed
he is equal for everyone
he is the one in which the world strings like pearls
he is serene & rejoices his own space
 
He knows everything about magic & talismans
He knows everything & respects his pride
He can dismantle anything & deathless
He speaks the language of 'Omkar' (The sound of sacred syllable)
 
Marijuana & dhatura are hoisted to him
He is the king of all the three lok's (hell,earth & heaven)
He is immortal even after drinking poison as well
He is the lord of universe who chants har har
 
He is zero & absolute
In whom Lord Shiva resides
 
This is Aghor mantra
(if someone repeats it regularly
He becomes equal to dues)
 
My salutations to the letter “Na” , which is Shiva
Who wears as garland the king of snakes
Who has three eyes
Who wears ash all over Him
Who is the greatest Lord
Who is forever
Who is the cleanest
And who wears the directions themselves as dress
 
Shiv protect us save us
 
Shiv protect us save us
Only you can guard us
 
He can see anything with eyes shut
He is playing with time
He is only great lord
For him this whole universe is minuscule
 
The holy river Ganges tied in his hair with moon as his crown
He can be loving and sometimes horrendous
He came in existence through fire and lives in Kailash mountain
He is more energetic then the energy itself
 
Ram & Ravan belongs to him
He can take or give life
He can be chaotic & forgiving
He teaches the way of life to everyone
 
When he opens his third eye(mounted on his forehead)
The earth & heaven shakes
His name echoes in every direction and on the horizon
All Hail Lord Shiva
 
He is zero & absolute
In whom Lord Shiva resides
 
He is zero & absolute
In whom Lord Shiva resides
 
Say har har har
 
Go to Kailash Mountain & Destroy
 
My salutations to the letter “Ya” , which is Shiva,
Who takes the form of Yaksha,
Who has a tufted hair,
Who is armed with spear,
Who is forever filled with peace,
Who is godly,
Who is the great God,
And who wears the directions themselves as dress."	3

Kissing your pictures
 
I'm in your love. Please accept
Finish all disputes
You will not get anyone like me
Note this words
 
Not obeying mother
You're doing insane
Taking lives of people
Showing that you're innocent

When you're become naughty
Not coming in hands
I'll die, so come with me

Give your hand in mine

Here I have to live and die.

Your streets suit me, your streets.
Your streets. Streets, your streets
They agonize me, your streets.
 
You sleep in my sleep,
You cry in my tears.
There is your whisper in my thoughts,
Even when you're not there, you are there.
You're the result of my pain..
They're the wishes of my heart, your steets.
 
How's this relationship of your and mine,
It doesn't have a face and yet it's so deep.
These moments, these moments like silk..
We shouldn't lose them.
The caravan of time, let's stop it.
Now (your streets) shouldn't get separated from the heart..
 
Your streets. Streets, your streets
They agonize me, your streets.

He was like a soaring kite
Where he had vanished, let's find him
 
While the paths always lead us
He always made his own path
Sometimes fell, sometimes balance but always went ahead cheerfully
 
We were always worried about tomorrow
He always celebrated today
He lived every minute fully
 
From where did he come
Where he had vanished,
touching our hearts
 
He was like a shade in scorching sun
He was like an oasis in a vast desert
He was like the medicine for the wounded heart
 
We were limited to well
He will do somersault in the river
He used to swim against the turbulent current
 
He was like a carefree cloud
He was our close friend
Where he had vanished, let's find him
 
While the paths always lead us
He always made his own path
Sometimes fell, sometimes balance but always went ahead cheerfully
 
We were always worried about tomorrow
He always celebrated today
He lived every minute fully
 
From where did he come
Where he had vanished,
touching our hearts"	4
Shaan 	Dastaan-E-Om Shanti Om	"Sunnewalon, suno aisa bhi hota hai
Dil deta hai jo woh jaan bhi khota hai
Pyar aisa jo karta hai, kya marke bhi marta hai
Aao tum bhi aaj sunlo
Dastaan hai yeh ke ek tha naujawan jo dil hi dil mein ek haseena ka tha deewana
Woh haseena thi ke jiski khubsoorti ka duniya bhar mein tha mashhoor afsana
Donon ki yeh kahani hai jis ko sabhi kehte hain Om Shanti Om
 
Naujawan ki thi aarzoo, uski thi yahi justuju
Us haseena mein usko mile ishq ke saare rang –o-hoor
Usne na jaana yeh naadani hai
Woh reth ko samjha ke paani hai
Kyun aisa tha kisliye tha yeh kahani hai…..
Dastaan hai yeh ke us dilkash haseena ke nigahon dil mein koi doosra hi tha
Bekhabar is baat se us naujawan ke khwabon ka anjaam toh hona bura hi tha
Toote khwabon ki is dastaan ko sabhi kehte hain Om Shanti Om
 
Sunnewalon, suno aisa bhi hota hai
Koi jitna hanse utna hi rota hai
Deewani hoke haseena khayi kya dhoke haseena
Aao tum bhi aaj sunlo
Dastaan hai yeh ke us masoom haseena ne jise chaha woh tha andar se harjaai
Sangdil se dil lagake bewafa ke haath aake usne ek din maut hi paayi
Ek sitam ka fasana hai jis ko sabhi kehte hain Om Shanti Om
 
Kyun koi qaatil samajhta nahin
Yeh jurm woh hai jo chhupta nahin
Yeh daag woh hai jo mit ta nahin
Rehte hain khooni ke raath par
Khoon us haseena ka jab tha hua
Koi wahan tha pahunch toh gaya
Lekin use toh bacha na saka
Roye tha pyar uski maath par
Dastaan hai yeh ke jo pehchaanta hai khooni ko woh naujawan hai lautke aaya
Keh rahi hai zindagi qaatil samajh le uske sar pe chha chuka hai maut ka saaya
Janmon ki karmon ki hai kahani jise kehte hain Om Shanti Om
kehte hain Om Shanti Om, kehte hain Om Shanti Om"	"Listen, all you people, it happens this way too-
Those who love, lose their lives too.
Ones who love like this, do they really die when they die?
Come and you listen...
The story goes that there was once a young lad who was crazy for a beautiful girl.
She was famous throughout the world for her beauty.
Their story is what everyone calls Om Shanti Om.
 
The young lad wished and desired
That he would find in her, love in all its splendour.
He didn’t realize how foolish he was,
He thought the sand was water.
Why and how this happened is the story.
The story goes that this beauty’s eyes and heart belonged to someone else.
The ignorant lad’s dreams were bound to have a bad ending.
This story of shattered dreams is what everyone calls Om Shanti Om.
 
Listen all you people, it happens this way too,
One who laughs a lot weeps a lot too.
Madly in love, the beauty was betrayed.
Come and listen...
The story goes that the innocent beauty was in love with a treacherous man.
By giving her heart to a merciless man, betrayed by him, she met her end one day.
The story of this injustice is what everyone calls Om Shanti Om.
 
Why doesn’t a murderer understand?
A crime cannot be hidden,
The stain cannot be erased,
It remains on his hands.
When that beautiful girl was murdered,
Someone was there to help her
But he couldn’t save her,
His love cried on her death.
The story goes that the one who recognizes the murderer, that lad has come back.
It’s life’s way of telling the murderer that the shadow of death has surrounded him.
This story of rebirth and destiny is what’s called Om Shanti Om
What’s called Om Shanti Om"	1

Shaan 	Mehsoor Kar	"Asar hua hai phir tera
Meri nazar mein tu hi tu
Khud ko bhi nehi phata
Mein is kadar samai hu
Inthiha bhi hai, awaz bhi is chahath ko kya naam dhoo
 
Chahu thuje mein is kadar
Mehsoos kar mehsoos kar
Chahu thuje mein is kadar mehsoos kar."	"You have effected me again
Only you are in my eyes
Even u don't know
How much I m into u
There is a twist,a new beginning
What name should I give 2 this wish?
I will love u so much ,u will feel it ..jst feel it(×4)
My heart was unaware
It beats faster listening your whisper
It makes noises
I m very helpless
We got shock from this world
My existence is only in u
I will b known (to this world)by u now
I will love u so much ,u will feel it ..just feel it (×4)
Let's b separated after meeting for sometime
Let's do something different
U will b the sky,I will become d surface
Let's choose a new dream together
We will meet at some turn
With the same story again
This is the only wish of my heart
I will love u so much that u will feel it ,just feel it(×4)"	2

We went away from home
We don't know where the road will lead us
The fragrence of wet ground
Brings tears to our eyes
We leave the world of our dreams behind in the memory
We have new aims and get going in a caravan
This road we walk alone
A lonely heart, a lonely journey
Then we do my eyes search for you
A lonely heart
I've seen many good things
Even the bright stars I've seen
But I still remember your face quite well
So much rain has fallen, such a blessing it was
But in my ears your words still resound clearly
We promised each other that the world belonged to us
I don't what will happen to these promises"	2

Hogai kaise khwahish ye jawan

Never seen a night like this before
This meeting is only for a few moments
Sky seems drowning in stars.
Why this moment slips away like sand
 
(Don't want to live without you now.
Never leave my arms
Never go away without asking me ) - (2)
 
Won't open my eyes
when you aren't in front of me
How could i think of a tomorrow
in which you are not there
you are not there,you are not there
 
I was childish in my youth
but your coming changed everything
How my wish matured
 
(I do not want to live without you now.
Never leave my arms
Never go away without asking me ) - (2)
 
Cindrella Cindrella
 
(I do not want to live without you now.
Never leave my arms
Never go away without asking me ) - (2)

I have been groaning for a long time to smile.
And you have been craving for a long time to come nigh.
While dwelling in your throbs.
While dwelling in your throbs.
And while staying in your breaths ever.

He talks in eyes only
silently, whispering..
He dives in the river of dreams
(sounds of diving/sinking/bubbles)
 
the mellow Barfi has come..
Barfi is a blister in the foot
Barfii is the light of nights
being silent only, he is upto mischieves
mischievous, he does that non-stop.
 
....
.... Oh God, save me from him
 
He talks in eyes only...
He dives in the river of dreams...
 
He never stops
He never stays
Whenever he sees sorrow
he kicks it with happiness
 
The harmonium of his eyelids (which keep going up and down all the time like a harmonium's air-filler)
He, on the rhythm of heartbeats
keeps on singing lovely songs
 
Don't consider him innocent
He is a very clever player
He will extinguish the sun
such a blow he will give
in the yard, the pond, under the Peepal tree,
He leaves no street..
 
He talks in eyes only...
He dives in the river of dreams...
 
Barfi was sleeping in mother's womb,
The mother ordered the radio of Murphy
The Murphy kid was mother's dream child
When the child came in this world slowly
The father set the station of Ceylon
 
The radio was switched on
The mother got turned off (she died)
Every dream ended
The child sheds tears mute only
The child cannot listen to the rattling toy"	1

I was able to breathe..
 
soul touched the body's fragrance,
when you came nearby..
 
how long can one remain in control,
when consciousness goes, let it go..
when has the heart gone on a straight path,
if the path turns, let it turn..
when I am in your thoughts,
loneliness feels good..
 
when the night goes in your arms,
morning looks very light,
have you started living in my eyes,
it keeps spilling..
touch me again and say,
have you sweared on me..
 
when your breath mixed in my breath,
I was able to breathe..
 
soul touched the body's fragrance,

Khuda tera hi yeh faisla hai

Do pal tujhse juda tha
Aise phir rasta muda tha
Tujhse mein khone laga juda jaise hone laga
Mujhse kuch mera
Tu hi meri liye ab kar dua
Tu hi iss dard se kar de juda
Tera hoke tera jo main na raha
Main yeh khud se kehta hoon

Tu nahin toh, inn labon pe ik shikaayat reh gayi hai

Black black blank nights, are becoming my friend..
Lost, lost in these paths, I have nothing of my own..
Every moment every Second, how I bear..
Every moment every Second, to myself, I keep saying..
I've forgotten you..
Then why do your memories..
make me cry..
 
I hear the words written in your memories..
Passed moments ask why we got separated like this.. God..
God, this distance I've got...
God, it's your decision...
God, it was supposed to be and it happened....That you had written
 
For two moments I was attached to you
Then the path was turned such..
I started getting lost from you
Like something was getting away..
that was mine
You only pray for me now
You only part me from this pain
Being yours, I am not anymore yours
I say this to myself
 
I've forgotten you
Then why do your memories
make me cry
 
Since you aren't here, these lips are only complaining
When you were gonna separate us then why did you got us close..
God sometime you will love too
God your love will get separated too
God then you will know pain of this distance (separation)"	2

Thinking about you,
I only flow in the thoughts about you.
 
I don't know how
I have ended up becoming yours

This moment... should just come to a standstill and the distance between us may fade away.
 
Since I have met you I have started to learn what living is
This moment... should just come to a standstill and the distance between us may fade away.
 
I am living more than I have ever before
Since I parted from you, I have walked the paths that you have
You are my destination and I have started to stop at your footsteps.
 
Since I have met you I have started to learn what living is
This moment... should just come to a standstill and the distance between us may fade away.
 
Since I have met you I have started to learn what living is
This moment... should just come to a standstill and the distance between us may fade away.
 
There is different kind of charm in your eyes
and the its renders a different state of fancy
The cloud that had been trapped since many days
has been set free in the strands of your hair
 
I live in your limits
I like in your world
I become the air/environment you live in
because of you I am a whole new person
I have said this before, but now I am saying this to you
 
Since I have met you I have started to learn what living is
This moment... should just come to a standstill and the distance between us may fade away.

Alka Yagnik	Aaye ho meri zindagi mein	"Aaye ho meri zindagi mein, tum bahar banke
Mere dil mein yunhi rahna, tum pyar pyar ban ke
Ankhon mein tum base ho, sapne hazaar ban ke
Mere dil mein yunhi rahna, tum pyar pyar ban ke- Aaye ho,,,
 
Mere saathi mere sajan, mere saath yun hi chalna
Badalega rang zamana, par tum nahi badalna
Meri mang yun hi bharna, taare hazaar ban ke
Mere dil mein yun hi rahna, tum pyar pyar ban ke
 
Agar main jo rooth jaoon, to tum mujhe manana
Thama hai haath mera, phir umr bhar nibhana
Mujhe chod ke na jana, wade hazaar kar ke
Mere dil mein yun hi rahna tum pyar pyar ban ke---Aaye ho"	"You have come into my life in the guise of spring
Stay in my heart always as love
You reside in my eyes as a thousand dreams
Stay in my heart always as love
 
My partner, my lover, be by my side always
this world will change, but don't you change
Decorate my forehead in the guise of a thousand stars
Stay in my heart always as love
 
If I get angry, then console me
Now that you have accepted me, now keep your word
Do not leave me after making so many dreams
Stay in my heart always as love"	1

Are betrayal of lips or words

If you're with me

In my blouse, there’s my heart, underneath my veil lies my heart (x2)
I'll give this heart to my partner, to my lover
Oh My!
Ku Ku Ku Ku...
 
You've got millions crazy after You
You've got so many old lovers
 
I haven't got a lover of my choice till now
It seems like a heartless city, what should I do?
Oh My!
Ku Ku Ku Ku...
 
Ku Ku Ku Ku...
My skirt is made of silk
My skirt is expensive
I walk carrying my skirt, I walk hiding my face underneath my veil
What all should I protect and walk, tell me O Lord Ram!
Oh My!
Ku Ku Ku Ku...
 
Someone save her
(Someone) Hide her in Your heart
There are many lovers after me
Some are pulling me here, some are pulling me there, what should I do?
Oh My!
Ku Ku Ku Ku...
 
Ku Ku Ku Ku...
(May someone) Get me married
(May someone) Decorate my wedding palanquin
May I not become a mistress, may I not become a saint
I can't bear this prime youth, what should I do?
Girl, Oh My!
Ku Ku Ku Ku...
 
Tell me how the girl should be
Tell me how the boy should be
The girl should be like me and the boy should be like You
Then there'll be fun in love
Wow!
Ku Ku Ku Ku...
 
Ku Ku Ku Ku...
Become the partner for the wanderer
Become the ankle bell for the anklet
Salute me, become my slave
You may be an emperor someplace (doesn't matter)
Go away
Ku Ku Ku Ku...
 
I'm in my innocent age
My love life is uneventful (till now)
O man of my dreams! Come back to me
I’m sleeping, keeping my doors open
Ah...
Ku Ku Ku Ku...
 
What’s the importance of a queen without a king?
What’s the importance of a king without a queen?
 
You know Your needs, I know mine
I've dedicated my youth to You
Oh Girl!
 
What's behind Your blouse? (x2)
What’s underneath Your veil?
 
Oh, in my blouse, there’s my heart, underneath my veil lies my heart (x2)
I'll give this heart to my partner, to my lover
Oh My!
 
In my blouse, there’s my heart, underneath my veil lies my heart (x6)"	1

Sometimes lost to wishes..
It's a 'chakor' of an angry moon.1
Why does have even
The slightest of reservations,
It doesn't ever bows to any pressure..
It doesn't care about the boundaries
That the world follows,
When your string pulls..
When your string pulls..
 
The mad heart goes towards you,
The mad heart goes towards you.2
 
In the situation of silences,
It looks for your noise..
 
The mad heart goes towards you,
 
The earth of the heart is dry,
The moisture is lost somewhere..
Your rains are my hope..
Even having borne the attacks of love,
And losing you again and again,
It still doesn't learn to plot against you..
 
For you I've run from myself today,
Collecting the remaining pieces of strength,
Have run from the world in hiding, silently,
Like some thief..
 
The mad heart goes towards you,
In the situation of silences,
It looks for your noise."	2

I have got you like a prayer,Oh God!
 
When I got you,it's like I lived
When I got you,I became complete
When I got you,a light spread,Oh God!
 
Feel safe for
I am always with you
I can't separate from you
Even for a moment
 
Now we are together
Like eyes with eyelids
Let's tell this to the time once again
 
Saving you from all grief,
Protecting you from every eye,
I have got you
 
Come in my arms,
All complains shall be finished on their own
I listen your lips,
Say something from the eyes
 
You are a shadow while I am the mirror
Then,what there is to think?
We have to attain each other by
Getting lost in each other
 
Waking my detiny
And defeating every world,
I have attained you"	1

There are new desires awakening in these thirsty lips
I want to burn myself in Your sighs
Come and attach Yourself to me, in my embrace

Come now, a little nearer, in these moments that we've been given by fate
Come on now, a little nearer, in these moments that we've been given by fate, let's live it
 
After forgetting this whole world
Underneath the shadows of bodies, there is slow breathing all night long
We are just the companions for a few moments
Both were here tonight, who knows where we shall be tomorrow
Come on now, make Yourselves mine
Who knows what's going to happen tomorrow
Come now, a little nearer, in these moments that we've been given by fate
Come on now, a little nearer, in these moments that we've been given by fate, let's live it
 
I am a silken dream
Take me onto Your eyelashes, I have given You this opportunity, O stranger
Let's not come back to our senses
Let both our lives be lost in one-another
Make me listen the silence of Your heartbeats
Who knows what's going to happen tomorrow
Come now, a little nearer, in these moments that we've been given by fate, come on now
These moments that we've been given by fate
 
May this night stop in Your arms
Come and attach Yourself to me, in my embrace
Who knows what's going to happen tomorrow
Come now, a little nearer, in these moments that we've been given by fate
Come now, a little nearer, in these moments that we've been given by fate, let's live it."	1

Which had fallen in the bazaar of Bareilly1

And I said that they'll attach ankle bells to me, as I've come
Take me with You and dance

Oh Come dance with me, my friend
The whole bazaar is robbed now
Forgetting everything, just dance
Come dance with me,

The whole bazaar is robbed now
 
Dance a little, Call people on the roof and then dance
Dance a little, Pick it up quickly and dance (x2)
 
I'd made a mistake, my nose ring had fallen down (x2)
And so I got it colored it a golden color (at the Goldsmith's)
After donning it, I came to the balcony
And then there was so much quarreling and fights in the neighbourhood
On my door-step there is a huge rush of crazy lovers
Dance after making everyone dance
Come dance with me,
 
My friend
Jhanak jhanak jhankaar
Oh Come dance with me, my friend
The whole bazaar is robbed now....
 
I was just a tender flower-bud who walked with pride (x2)
I went ahead and swirled a little in the lane
I didn't realize when I reached my prime youth
The world's wealth bows down to me
Even the confectioner gives me loans

I shall open my chests for the arrows shot from Your gaze
Give me a sign, I'll sacrifice all which is mine

Oh, you are in my heartbeats
In my body and soul
In my breath

My kohl shines only if you are there
My gajra (flower-chains in the hair) is fragrant only in your presence

I have forgotten every usual activity.
By whose grace, this world has transformed.
This feeling in me brings me amusement.
The feeling has arisen in me as if it is raining the first time.
Such magic impacted on me,
I have forgotten every usual activity.
By whose grace, this world has transformed.
A dream lives in me implicitly as I am living.
Dream.
It is all my imagination.
Without sleeping, without waking, all the same.
The feeling has arisen in me as if it is raining the first time.
Such magic impacted on me,
I have forgotten every usual activity.
By whose grace, this world has transformed.
Someone reads in secret my intentions.
If I try to see everything in the right perspective; it shows subjective.
It looks, the moon is on the land, and the land behind the clouds.
And the clouds in perspective looks everything biased.
The feeling has arisen in me as if it is raining the first time.
Such magic impacted on me,
I have forgotten every usual activity.
By whose grace, this world has transformed."

I'm astonished to see your face
Masha Allah, your face
 
And You are
Created for me by God
Beloved, I see God in you
 
Leave all the gossips of the world
It's a liar and eccentric
Without you, this World
Is nothing but lonely wilderness
I want to be with you
I want to blend with your smell
And colour, and be your part
 
Are you a dream or a mirage
A thief or a seductress
You are a dancer, but(you) make people dance
No one has understood untill(now)
The blade of your eyes
Is the sharpest blade of all(depicting her eyes)
Whoever sees you is trapped(in love with you)"

If I want to,
I could take you.

Let's see what you've got.]
You'll drown,
You're beauty will be trounced.
[I'll set fire, burn you down.]
This vanity will make me stay.

Don't walk away]
I'm a here to stay,

Sometime you too say our name..

But from the heart, you're a mean girl.

Wow, what a thing to say!
You still have time friends, move away/leave right now,
otherwise You’ll regret in the morning

This sauciness/vividness, this style/grace, this jauntiness/jolliness
How can the world decide the price (of the above three qualities of mine)?
Wow, what a thing to say!
Okay, now tell me this, if I take all these three in a package together,
will You reduce some price?
Ha Ha Ha Ha...
Gentleman, don’t make fun of beauty
May You not get insulted(made fun of) by the hands of this beauty (by me)
You’re free spirited, You’re beautiful (handsome), but still You’re a boy
Who can make You understand the difference between a boy and a man?

You have a lovely face
But You have a foolish mind too

The same way I am incomplete without you
 
When I got you,
Nothing lacked and there was no search
My incomplete moments became complete
 
If the night is empty,
I'll fill it with dreams, the moon, and stars
I'll fulfill your every wish
Without you saying it
 
I am incomplete and become complete with you
I don't know when this deal was finalized
Of incomplete stories, equal shares
You are heart and I am prayer
 
When I got you,
Nothing lacked and there was no search
My incomplete moments became complete
 
If you get lost,
I'll live my whole life lost
If the destination is asleep,
I'll give all my dreams to your eyes
 
Even if you bring half a heart,
I'll fill it with many desires
If you don't trust me
Come and test me

It true that its all the fault of this moment.
In every heartbeat a sorrow lives.
I wonder why then this heart says
""Live a little, live a little.""
This heart says ""Live a little.""
Oh my companion, oh my partner,
Come closer. Live a little.
 
I agree, that life is full of pain,
Even so it has this relief,
That I am yours, and you mine,
Let's so remain, and our affection too.
Then why have the connections between our hearts broken?
And why are we so averse to living?
Come let us open the door to our hearts,
Come let us cry our hearts out,
Live a little, live a little,
This heart says ""Live a little.""
Oh my companion, oh my partner,
Come closer. Live a little.
 
Let these clouds of grief go away,
Let our lives be cleansed,
Leave behind the bearing of painful memories,
And listen to what your heart is saying,
 
""Live a little, live a little.""
This heart says ""Live a little.""
Oh my companion, oh my partner,
Come closer. Live a little"	2

My traditional girl,
My traditional girl
girl girl girl girl (x2)
 
She drops her earring,
And if she meets your eye, she'll destroy your sight.
 
And if she dances,
Everybody's heartbeats beat in sync with her feet.
 
She lays her trap by her oceanic walk,
Making your heart a sorry state
All the romantics agree
They've never seen a girl like that
 
Never seen a girl like that
 
(Chorus)
I've seen a million foreign women,
But ain't nobody like my traditional girl.
 
I've seen a million foreign women,
But the most beautiful and simple is my traditional girl.
 
Who's the hottest girl in the world,
My traditional girl,
My traditional girl.
 
By the jerk of her waist, she'll rock your world
My traditional girl,
My traditional girl.
 
My traditional girl,
My traditional girl.
 
If your eye falls upon her waist,
All your dreams will be filled with colour
 
If she takes your hand
Lovers will lose their lives just smiling,
No matter where you look in the world,
You'll never find a girl like this.
 
I've seen a million foreign women,
But ain't nobody like my traditional girl.
 
I've seen a million foreign women,

My traditional girl,
My traditional girl.
 
My traditional girl,
My traditional girl.
 
(Female part)
Wherever I go,
All the eyes follow me
If I just stop for a moment,
All those cold breaths stop dead.
Everybody's eyes say
That they've dreamt of a girl like me,
A girl like me.
 
(Chorus)
I've seen a million foreign women,
But ain't nobody like my traditional girl.
 
I've seen a million foreign women,
But the most beautiful and simple is my traditional girl.
 
Who's the hottest girl in the world,

Everybody's heartbeats beat in sync with her feet.

Making your heart a sorry state
All the romantics agree
They've never seen a girl like that
 
Never seen a girl like that
 
(Chorus)
I've seen a million foreign women,
But ain't nobody like my traditional girl.
 
I've seen a million foreign women,
But the most beautiful and simple is my traditional girl.
 
Who's the hottest girl in the world,
My traditional girl,

By the jerk of her waist, she'll rock your world

Vishal Dadlani	Shake It Like Shammi	"Thodi-thodi dheeli-dheeli
Thodi-thodi geeli-geeli
Thodi-thodi mili-juli feeling.
Pal mein guzar jaaye
Pal mein thehar jaaye
Hai yeh badi silly-silly feeling.
 
Yippee, aaj hum hippie
Naachenge, koodenge, chhoo lenge ceiling
Lakh main rokoon
Ho maane na kamariya nikammi
Beat baje to...
I gotta shake it like Shammi
I gotta shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it like Shammi
 
Ha ha ha ha... here we go
Na na na na... now you know
This is the way we do it
This is the way we want..
 
Ladies be loosin it
Gentlemen out of control
Move your body to the ne ne new sound
Get up.. get up, get up..
You can be sittin' around now
Can't be combination of the new 'n' old
I love a little bit of old school rock 'n' roll
 
Phuljhadi... Aankhon mein diwaali
Baaton mein qawwali
Chhori ka lehza mast hai
Phuljhadi...
Dekhe jo bhi kehta hai zabardast hai
Nazrein churaane aayi
Paagal banaane aayi
Apne andaaz mein
 
Lara lappa, lara lappa la la la.. la..
Lara lappa, lara lappa la la la.. la..
 
Ha ha ha ha....
 
Bedhadak.. mauj manaa le
Raaton ke hawaale
Kar de saari uljhanein
Bedhadak.. aisa mauka phir tujhe mile na mile
Tezi se chadhta hai
Dheere utarta hai
Jashn ka yeh nasha
 
Piyein.. aaj full jiyein
Jitna chaahe daante re Daddy ya Mummy
 
Lakh main rokoon
Ho maane na kamariya nikammi
Beat baje to...
Everybody gotta shake it like Shammi
I gotta shake it like Shammi
I gotta shake it, shake it, shake it!
Shake it like Shammi!"	"A little loose,
A little wet,
A little mixed up feeling,
It goes in a moment,
It sticks in a moment,
It's a very silly-silly feeling.
 
Yippee today we're hippie,
We'll dance, jump, touch the ceiling..
Even if I try hard to stop,
the jobless waist doesn't listen to me..
When there is a beat playing,
I gotta shake it like Shammi
I gotta shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it like Shammi
 
Ha ha ha ha... here we go
Na na na na... now you know
This is the way we do it
This is the way we want..

Sparkler... There is Diwali (like shine) in eyes,
There is (music like) qawwali in talks,
The girl's style is fun..
Sparkler...
Whoever looks at her, says she's superb
She's come to steal your sights,
To make you mad,
In her style..
 
Lara lappa, lara lappa la la la.. la..
Lara lappa, lara lappa la la la.. la..
 
Ha ha ha ha....
 
(Be) carefree, have fun,
Give all the problems
To the night,
Carefree, such a chance may not be there again,
It goes high soon,
Comes down slowly,
Ihis intoxication of celebration..
 
Let's drink, let's live fully today,
However much daddy or mummy sclod..
 
Even if I try hard to stop,
The jobless waist doesn't listen to me..
When there is a beat playing,
Everybody gotta shake it like Shammi
I gotta shake it like Shammi
I gotta shake it, shake it, shake it!
Shake it like Shammi!"	1
Sukhwinder Singh	Banjara 	"Banjara banjara
Dil mera banjara
Dekha jab se usko
Dil mera dil mera banjara
Na jaaga na soya
Dil mera dil mera banjara
 
Jo muskuraye wo
Sab kuch bhulaye woh
Dekho bhai phans gaya re dil bechara
Banjara, banjara
Uski dhun mein dil banjara
Banjara, banjara
Uski dhun mein dil banjara
 
Lehra ke dil se guzarti hai wo,
jaane kya gitpit karti hai wo,
hans de to ude dil mein hain titliyaan
bemausam gire hum pe hain bijliyaan
us pe ye dil o o ye haara
 
Banjara, banjara
Uski dhun mein dil banjara
Banjara, banjara
Uski dhun mein dil banjara
 
baaton mein uski jaadugari,
nigahon mein uski kaarigari,
o saikadon khwaab uspe hain kharcha kiye,
phir bhi milne ko har roz tarsa kiye
keh de to chhod doon main ye jag saara
 
Banjara, banjara
Uski dhun mein dil banjara
Banjara, banjara
Uski dhun mein dil banjara"	"nomad, nomad,
my heart is a homeless nomad..
Since I saw her,
My heart is a nomad..
Neither it wakes nor sleeps,
My heart is a nomad..
 
when she smiles,
she makes me forget everything,
see my innocent heart is caught in the web..
nomad, nomad,
the heart is nomad for her now.
nomad, nomad,
the heart is nomad for her now..
 
she passes through the heart with a wave,
I don't know what she talks,
when she laughs, butterflies fly in the heart,
there is lightning on me without the season,
on her, this heart is all lost..
 
nomad, nomad,
the heart is nomad for her now..
nomad, nomad,
the heart is nomad for her now..
 
In her talks there is a magic,
In here eyes there is a craft,
I have spent thousands of dreams on her dreams,
but still I crave to meet her..
If she says so, I'll leave this whole world..
 
nomad, nomad,
the heart is nomad for her now..
nomad, nomad,
the heart is nomad for her now."	1

You went to find her, why didn't you?
Your dreams broken, isn't it now?
 
I requested my mind to think about you
I requested my mind not to tink about you
I am yearning for you
I never yearned like this
You went to find her, why didn't you?
Your dreams broken, isn't it now?she's my love, my darling
She left me on the 24th of last month
 
You went to find her, why didn't you?
Your dreams broken, isn't it now?
