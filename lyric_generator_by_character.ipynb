dinghy rapids,\\\\nKeep this rapping a habit\\\\nAnd keep on fashioning magic,\\\\nI'm battling with respect,\\\\nI don't know if I'll have it,\\\\nThis songs from the heart,\\\\nCovering the planet,\\\\nI'll take it back now\\\\n\\\\n[chorus]\\\\nCome on and take it back love\\\\nCome on and take it back for us\\\\nDon't you fade into the back love, oh\\\\n\\\\nTake it back now\\\\nNow, I don't ever want to be perfect,\\\\nCause I'm a singer that you\\\\nNever want to see shirtless\\\\nI accept the fact that someone's got to win the worst-dressed,\\\\nTaking my first steps into the scene,\\\\nGiving me focus\\\\nPutting on a brave face, like Timothy Dalton\\\\nConsidering a name change,\\\\nThinking it was hopeless\\\\nRhyming over recordings\\\\nAvoiding tradition\\\\nCause every day some lyrics\\\\nAnd a melody can be written\\\\nNow absence can make your heart ache\\\\nBut drinking absinthe can change your mind-state, vividly,\\\\nI need to let my liver be\\\\nAnd I say it again,\\\\nLiving life on the edge,\\\\nWith a closed hand full of friends\\\\nIs good advice from a man\\\\nWho took his life on the road with me\\\\nAnd I hope to see him blowing up globally\\\\nCause that's how it's supposed to be\\\\nI'm screaming out vocally\\\\nMight seem totally impossible\\\\nAchieving life's dreams\\\\nBut, but I just write schemes\\\\nI'm never having a stylist, giving me tight jeans\\\\nMadison Square Garden is where I might be\\\\nBut more likely,\\\\nYou'll find me in the back\\\\nRoom of a dive bar with my mates\\\\nHaving a pint with McDaid\\\\nDiscussing records we made\\\\nAnd every single second knowing\\\\nThat we'll never betray\\\\nThe way we were raised\\\\nRemembering our background\\\\nSat down\\\\nThat's how we plan it out;\\\\nIt's time to take it back now\\\\n\\\\n[chorus]\\\\nCome on and take it back love\\\\nCome on and take it back for us\\\\nDon't you fade into the back love, oh\\\\n\\\\nCome on and take it back love\\\\nCome on and take it back for us\\\\nDon't you fade into the back love, oh\\\\n\\\\nMy dreams keep me awake at night\\\\nWritten in rhymes, and lies, deliver the hype\\\\nAm I just living the lie\\\\nWith this you must know that the number's just sold woah\\\\nWill keep me going through the tough times, dream with me\\\\nWe forget 90 per cent of it when we wake\\\\nBut the other 10 per cent it never fades\\\\nDreaming dreams, day to day goals\\\\nStay awake loads, try to make the cut like the\\\\nPaper or razor blade, oh, never give up\\\\nAnd just remember just to hold out more\\\\nA couple years ago\\\\nI couldn't just control that thought\\\\nYou'd find me buskin' on the street\\\\nWhen it was cold outdoors\\\\nAnd now I'm sweating on the stage\\\\nOf a sold out tour\\\\nWriting love songs for the sake of it\\\\nNever to make a hit\\\\nYou can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick\\\\nI'm not a rapper I'm a singer, I just take the piss and\\\\nMost of these other guys are kids that posties\\\\nLittle sister has to babysit, that's just a way it is\\\\nDreams are your own, just set your goals\\\\nAnd have the utmost faith in it; tread your own path\\\\nYou'll never make it as a follower, you'll never know\\\\nWhere you will go or where you will be tomorrow\"\n",

really looking for another mistake\\\\nI called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait\\\\nBut then I jump right in\\\\nA week later return\\\\nI reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn\\\\nBut I gave her my time for two or three nights\\\\nThen I put it on pause until the moment was right\\\\nI went away for months until our paths crossed again\\\\nShe told me I was never looking for a friend\\\\nMaybe you could swing by my room around 10\\\\nBaby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin\\\\nWe’ll be in between the sheets until the late AM\\\\nBaby if you wanted me then you should’ve just said\\\\nShe’s singing\\\\nAh-la-la-la-la\\\\nDon’t fuck with my love\\\\nThat heart is so cold\\\\nAll over my arm\\\\nI don’t wanna know that babe\\\\nAh-la-la-la-la\\\\nDon’t fuck with my love\\\\nI told her she knows\\\\nTake aim and reload\\\\nI don’t wanna know that babe\\\\nAh-la-la-la-la\\\\nFor a couple weeks I\\\\nOnly want to see her\\\\nWe drink away the days with a take away pizza\\\\nBefore a text message was the only way to reach her\\\\nNow she’s staying at my place and loves the way I treat her\\\\nSinging out Aretha\\\\nAll over the track like a feature\\\\nNever want to sleep I guess that I don’t want to either\\\\nBut me and her we make money the same way\\\\nFour cities, two planes the same day\\\\nThose shows have never been what it’s about\\\\nBut maybe we’ll go together and just figure it out\\\\nI’d rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch\\\\nBut we should get on a plane\\\\nOr we’ll be missing it now\\\\nWish I’d have written it down\\\\nThe way that things played out\\\\nWhen she was kissing him\\\\nHow? I was confused about\\\\nShe should figure it out while I’m sat here singing\\\\nAh-la-la-la-la\\\\nDon’t fuck with my love\\\\nThat heart is so cold\\\\nAll over my arm\\\\nI don’t wanna know that babe\\\\nAh-la-la-la-la\\\\nDon’t fuck with my love\\\\nI told her she knows\\\\nTake aim and reload\\\\nI don’t wanna know that babe\\\\nAh-la-la-la-la\\\\n*Knock knock knock* on my hotel door\\\\nI don’t even know if she knows what for\\\\nShe was crying on my shoulder\\\\nI already told ya\\\\nTrust and respect is what we do this for\\\\nI never intended to be next\\\\nBut you didn’t need to take him to bed that’s all\\\\nAnd I never saw him as a threat\\\\nUntil you disappeared with him to have sex of course\\\\nIt’s not like we were both on tour\\\\nWe were staying on the same fucking hotel floor\\\\nAnd I wasn’t looking for a promise or commitment\\\\nBut it was never just fun and I thought you were different\\\\nThis is not the way you realize what you wanted\\\\nIt’s a bit too much, too late if I’m honest\\\\nAll this time God knows I’m singing\\\\nAh-la-la-la-la\\\\nDon’t fuck with my love\\\\nThat heart is so cold\\\\nAll over my arm\\\\nI don’t wanna know that babe\\\\nAh-la-la-la-la\\\\nDon’t fuck with my love\\\\nI told her she knows\\\\nTake aim and reload\\\\nI don’t wanna know that babe\\\\nAh-la-la-la-laOh, maybe I came on too strong\\\\nMaybe I waited too long\\\\nMaybe I played my cards wrong\\\\nOh, just a little bit wrong\\\\nBaby I apologize for it\\\\n\\\\nI could fall, or I could fly\\\\nHere in your aeroplane\\\\nAnd I could live, I could die\\\\nHanging on the words you say\\\\nAnd I\\'ve been known to give my all\\\\nAnd jumping in harder than\\\\nTen thousand rocks on the lake\\\\n\\\\nSo don\\'t call me baby\\\\nUnless you mean it\\\\nDon\\'t tell me you need me\\\\nIf you don\\'t believe it\\\\nSo let me know the truth\\\\nBefore I dive right into you\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYou\\'re a mystery\\\\nI have travelled the world, there\\'s no other girl like you\\\\nNo one, what\\'s your history?\\\\nDo you have a tendency to lead some people on?\\\\n\\'Cause I heard you do, mm\\\\n\\\\nI could fall, or I could fly\\\\nHere in your aeroplane\\\\nAnd I could live, I could die\\\\nHanging on the words you say\\\\nAnd I\\'ve been known to give my all\\\\nAnd lie awake everyday\\\\nDon\\'t know how much I can take\\\\nSo don\\'t call me baby\\\\nUnless you mean it\\\\nDon\\'t tell me you need me\\\\nIf you don\\'t believe it\\\\nSo let me know the truth\\\\nBefore I dive right into you\\\\n\\\\nI could fall, or I could fly\\\\nHere in your aeroplane\\\\nAnd I could live, I could die\\\\nHanging on the words you say\\\\nAnd I\\'ve been known to give my all\\\\nSitting back, looking at\\\\nEvery mess that I\\'ve made\\\\nSo don\\'t call me baby\\\\nUnless you mean it\\\\nDon\\'t tell me you need me\\\\nIf you don\\'t believe it\\\\nSo let me know the truth\\\\nBefore I dive right into you\\\\nBefore I dive right into you\\\\nBefore I dive right into youI wanna be drunk when I wake up\\\\nOn the right side of the wrong bed\\\\nAnd every excuse I made up\\\\nTell you the truth I hate\\\\nWhat didn\\'t kill me\\\\nIt never made me stronger at all.\\\\nLove will scar your make-up lip sticks to me\\\\nSo now I\\'ll maybe leave back there\\\\nI\\'m sat here wishing I was sober\\\\nI know I\\'ll never hold you like I used to.\\\\n\\\\nBut our house gets cold when you cut the heating\\\\nWithout you to hold I\\'ll be freezing\\\\nCan\\'t rely on my heart to beat it\\\\n\\'Cause you take part of it every evening\\\\nTake words out of my mouth just from breathing\\\\nReplace with phrases like when you\\'re leaving me.\\\\n\\\\nShould I, should I?\\\\nMaybe I\\'ll get drunk again\\\\nI\\'ll be drunk again\\\\nI\\'ll be drunk again\\\\nTo feel a little love\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI wanna hold your heart in both hands\\\\nI\\'ll watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can\\\\nAnd I\\'ve got no plans for the weekend\\\\nSo shall we speak then\\\\nKeep it between friends\\\\nThough I know you\\'ll never love me like you used to.\\\\n\\\\nThere maybe other people like us\\\\nYou see the flicker of the clip when they light up\\\\nFlames just create us, burns don\\'t heal like before\\\\nYou don\\'t hold me anymore.\\\\n\\\\nOn cold days Coldplay\\'s out like the band\\'s the name\\\\nI know I can\\'t heal things with a hand shake\\\\nYou know I can\\'t change as I began saying\\\\nYou cut me wide open like landscape\\\\nOpen bottles of beer but never champagne\\\\nWe\\'ll applaud you with the sound that my hands make.\\\\n\\\\nShould I, should I?\\\\nMaybe I\\'ll get drunk again\\\\nI\\'ll be drunk again\\\\nI\\'ll be drunk again\\\\nTo feel a little love.\\\\n\\\\nAll by myself\\\\nI\\'m here again\\\\nAll by myself\\\\nYou know I\\'ll never change\\\\nAll by myself\\\\nAll by myself\\\\nI\\'m just drunk again\\\\nI\\'ll be drunk again\\\\nI\\'ll be drunk again\\\\nTo feel a little love.I was born inside a small town, I\\\\\\'ve lost that state of mind\\\\nLearned to sing inside the Lord\\\\\\'s house, but stopped at the age of nine\\\\nI forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride\\\\nThe paving stones I played upon, they kept me on the grind\\\\nSo blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life\\\\nFriends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride\\\\nAnd when the world\\\\\\'s against me is when I really come alive\\\\nAnd everyday that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride\\\\nYou know that I\\\\\\'ve got whisky with white lines and smoke in my lungs\\\\nI think life has got to the point I know without it\\\\\\'s no fun\\\\nI need to get in the right mind and clear myself up\\\\nInstead, I look in the mirror questioning what I\\\\\\'ve become\\\\nI guess it\\\\\\'s a stereotypical day for someone like me\\\\nWithout a nine-to-five job or an uni degree\\\\nTo be caught up in the trappings of the industry\\\\nThey showed me the locked doors I find another use of key\\\\nAnd you\\\\\\'ll see\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'m well aware of certain things that will destroy a man like me\\\\nBut with that said give me one more, higher\\\\nAnother one to take the sting away\\\\nI am happy on my own, so here I\\\\\\'ll stay\\\\nSave your lovin\\\\\\' arms for a rainy day\\\\nAnd I\\\\\\'ll find comfort in my pain\\\\nEraser\\\\n\\\\nI used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs\\\\nI chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong\\\\nI think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell\\\\nRelationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well\\\\nAnd ain\\\\\\'t nobody wanna see you down in the dumps\\\\nBecause you\\\\\\'re living your dream, man, this shit should be fun\\\\nPlease know that I\\\\\\'m not trying to preach like I\\\\\\'m Reverend Run\\\\nI beg you, don\\\\\\'t be disappointed with the man I\\\\\\'ve become\\\\nOur conversations with my father on the A14\\\\nAge twelve telling me I\\\\\\'ve gotta chase those dreams\\\\nNow I\\\\\\'m playing for the people, dad, and they know me\\\\nWith my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans\\\\nWembley Stadium crowd two hundred and forty thou\\\\nI may have grown up but I hope that Damien\\\\\\'s proud\\\\nAnd to the next generation, inspiration\\\\\\'s allowed\\\\nThe world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now\\\\nSomehow\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'m well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me\\\\nBut with that said give me one more, higher\\\\nAnother one to take the sting away\\\\nI am not beyond my own, so here I\\\\\\'ll stay\\\\nSave your lovin arms for a rainy day\\\\nAnd I\\\\\\'ll find comfort in my pain\\\\nEraser\\\\nAnd I\\\\\\'ll find comfort in my pain\\\\nEraser\\\\nAnd I\\\\\\'ll find comfort in my pain\\\\nEraser\\\\n\\\\nI woke up this morning lookin\\\\\\' in the mirror\\\\nThinkin\\\\\\' to myself that I should probably be thinner\\\\nThe industry told me to look like them\\\\nBut I found my happiness in fried food for my dinner\\\\nI wish that she could have been my first time\\\\nAnd I wish that I\\\\\\'d never took that first line\\\\nAnd I wish that every word in this verse rhymed\\\\nBut forgive me if it doesn\\\\\\'t\\\\nI wish that I could make peace with my older cousin\\\\nI wish he didn\\\\\\'t think that it was me when it wasn\\\\\\'t\\\\nI wish I didn\\\\\\'t love it when I\\\\\\'m high and my face feels buzzin\\\\\\'\\\\nAnd the taste stays underneath my tongue\\\\nWish that I had known what to do as a youngling\\\\nWish I hadn\\\\\\'t dropped out of school and missed every single party\\\\nWith that hardly matters now, man, does it?\\\\nWish I had an answer to everything, but fuck it\\\\nI wish creatin\\\\\\' art didn\\\\\\'t come with a budget\\\\nBut while we\\\\\\'re on the subject\\\\nI wish my private life would have never gone public\\\\nBut that\\\\\\'s the sacrifice that we make\\\\nSpendin\\\\\\' my whole time high livin\\\\\\' life away\\\\n\\\\nSingin\\\\\\' this is how we\\\\\\'re livin\\\\\\' down here\\\\nSittin\\\\\\' on the edge, lookin\\\\\\' out without fear\\\\nYeah, we got drama but you know we don\\\\\\'t care\\\\nI wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish\\\\nI\\\\\\'m singin\\\\\\' this is how we\\\\\\'re livin\\\\\\' down here\\\\nSittin\\\\\\' on the edge, lookin\\\\\\' out without fear\\\\nYeah, we got drama but you know we don\\\\\\'t care\\\\nI wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish\\\\n\\\\nI wish my family and friends they stay healthy\\\\nI wish that love was a currency and the whole world was wealthy\\\\nI found myself late night wishin\\\\\\' on a star\\\\nEveryday I wish I\\\\\\'d never broken a heart, uh\\\\nAnd I wish I\\\\\\'d never run to\\\\nEvery woman that I loved that kept my life and what it\\\\\\'s come to\\\\nI wish I was the role model you looked up to\\\\nIf I told my fans the things I did they\\\\\\'d say, \"Fuck you\"\\\\nI wish I was home more\\\\nI wish my teens could see the kids on the birthdays, but yo, we\\\\\\'re on tour\\\\nAnd I wish I\\\\\\'d grow more, wish I told more\\\\nPeople that I love \\\\\\'em but it\\\\\\'s in the music that I\\\\\\'m known for\\\\nAnd I wish he never got cancer\\\\nAnd if I smoke a pack a day, well, does that make me a wanker?\\\\nOh yes, I guess it does, and we\\\\\\'re still stressin\\\\\\' \\\\\\'cause\\\\nEvery day this shit gets the best of us\\\\nUsin\\\\\\' my balance on eraser blades\\\\nSpendin\\\\\\' my whole time high wishing life would wait\\\\n\\\\nSingin\\\\\\' this is how we\\\\\\'re livin\\\\\\' down here\\\\nSittin\\\\\\' on the edge, lookin\\\\\\' out without fear\\\\nYeah, we got drama but you know we don\\\\\\'t care\\\\nI wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish\\\\nI\\\\\\'m singin\\\\\\' this is how we\\\\\\'re livin\\\\\\' down here\\\\nSittin\\\\\\' on the edge, lookin\\\\\\' out without fear\\\\nYeah, we got drama but you know we don\\\\\\'t care\\\\nI wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'m using jumpers for goalposts, cigarettes for throat cold\\\\nMum sayin\\\\\\', \"Don\\\\\\'t smoke,\" no, I don\\\\\\'t listen, I got\\\\nLove for a ghost note, shows on the gold coast\\\\nPeople that I don\\\\\\'t know share the same vision\\\\nI find truth in the hard times and words that aren\\\\\\'t mine\\\\nTryin\\\\\\' to find a love with a compatible star sign\\\\nSometimes I can\\\\\\'t write, sentences can\\\\\\'t rhyme\\\\nStarin\\\\\\' at my notepad quick, I\\\\\\'m tryin\\\\\\' to find mine\\\\nShit, quick before I hit it again\\\\nSurrounded in the industry by all these ignorant men\\\\nAnd who knew that I\\\\\\'d be paid just to pick up a pen\\\\nJust let me hit the studio when we can rip it again\\\\nI\\\\\\'m a competitive dick, with an adrenaline kick\\\\nMy daddy told me work hard and you can never be shit\\\\nI\\\\\\'ve seen all my heroes dethroned except my dad\\\\nSet back here reminiscing \\\\\\'bout the times we had\\\\nOne wishIt’s alright to cry\\\\nEven my dad does sometimes\\\\nSo don’t wipe your eyes\\\\nTears remind you you’re alive\\\\nIt’s alright to die\\\\nCause death\\'s the only thing you haven’t tried\\\\nBut just for tonight hold on\\\\n\\\\nSo live life like you’re giving up\\\\nCause you act like you are\\\\nGo ahead and just live it up\\\\nGo on and tear me apart\\\\n\\\\nIt’s alright to shake\\\\nEven my hand does sometimes\\\\nSo inside the rage Against the dying of the light\\\\nIt’s alright to say that death’s the only thing you haven’t tried\\\\nBut just for today hold on\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSo live life like you’re giving up\\\\nCause you act like you are\\\\nGo ahead and just live it up\\\\nGo on and tear me apart\\\\n\\\\nSo live life like your giving up\\\\nCause you act like you are\\\\nGo ahead and just live it up\\\\nGo on and tear me apart hold on\\\\n\\\\nSo live life like your giving up\\\\nCause you act like you are\\\\nGo ahead and just live it up\\\\nGo on and tear me apart hold onI didn\\'t mean to break your heart\\\\nI was just lonely\\\\nAnd everybody falls apart sometimes\\\\nI know you\\'ve found another one\\\\nBut won\\'t you just hold me tonight\\\\nI wish I never called you up\\\\nNobody told me\\\\nAnd they don\\'t know, they don\\'t speak anymore\\\\nSo take a good look at us\\\\nWon\\'t you just hold me tonight\\\\nAnd I would stop trying to fall in love again\\\\nAnd keep it a secret\\\\nIt never works out anyway\\\\nBut I am not, anything like a voice\\\\nCause you were the only one for me\\\\nYeah, yeah\\\\n\\\\nCause maybe I don\\'t want to lose a lover and friend in one night\\\\nIf that\\'s right\\\\nI shouldn\\'t have f*cked with your mind\\\\nAnd your life too many times\\\\nOr maybe I don\\'t want to be lonely\\\\nDarling you are my only love\\\\nBehind my true loves, everything you are\\\\n\\\\nI never meant to sleep around\\\\nI was just lonely\\\\nYou did the same, again, and again\\\\nI know\\\\nSo here\\'s to the both of us\\\\nHere\\'s to our story tonight\\\\nOh I would stop trying to fall in love again\\\\nAnd keep it a secret\\\\nIt never works out anyway\\\\nBut I am not, anything like a voice\\\\nCause you were the only one for me\\\\nYeah\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCause maybe I don\\'t want to lose a lover and friend in one night\\\\nIf that\\'s right\\\\nI shouldn\\'t have f*cked with your mind\\\\nAnd your life too many times\\\\nOr maybe I don\\'t want to be lonely\\\\nDarling you are my only love\\\\nBehind my true loves, everything you are\\\\n\\\\nWhen I see my future\\\\nIt is with you\\\\nWe\\'ll get there\\\\nI want my children to be with you together\\\\n\\\\nCause maybe I don\\'t want to lose a lover and friend in one night\\\\nIf that\\'s right\\\\nI shouldn\\'t have f*cked with your mind\\\\nAnd your life too many times\\\\nOr maybe I don\\'t want to be lonely\\\\nDarling you are my only love\\\\nBehind my true loves, everything you are\\\\nBehind my true loves, everything you are\\\\nBehind my true loves, everything you areWe\\'re not, no we\\'re not friends, nor have we ever been\\\\nWe just try to keep those secrets in our lives\\\\nAnd if they find out, will it all go wrong?\\\\nI never know, no one wants it to\\\\n\\\\nSo I could take the back road\\\\nBut your eyes\\'ll lead me straight back home\\\\nAnd if you know me like I know you\\\\nYou should love me, you should know\\\\n\\\\nFriends just sleep in another bed\\\\nAnd friends don\\'t treat me like you do\\\\nWell I know that there\\'s a limit to everything\\\\nBut my friends won\\'t love me like you\\\\nNo, my friends won\\'t love me like you\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWe\\'re not friends, we could be anything\\\\nIf we tried to keep those secrets safe\\\\nNo one will find out if it all went wrong\\\\nThey\\'ll never know what we\\'ve been through\\\\n\\\\nSo I could take the back road\\\\nBut your eyes\\'ll lead me straight back home\\\\nAnd if you know me like I know you\\\\nYou should love me, you should know\\\\n\\\\nFriends just sleep in another bed\\\\nAnd friends don\\'t treat me like you do\\\\nWell I know that there\\'s a limit to everything\\\\nBut my friends won\\'t love me like you\\\\nNo, my friends won\\'t love me like you\\\\n\\\\nBut then again, if we\\'re not friends\\\\nSomeone else might love you too\\\\nAnd then again, if we\\'re not friends\\\\nThere\\'d be nothing I could do, and that\\'s why\\\\n\\\\nFriends should sleep in other beds\\\\nAnd friends should kiss me like you do\\\\nAnd I know that there\\'s a limit to everything\\\\nBut my friends won\\'t love me like you\\\\nNo, my friends won\\'t love me like you\\\\nOh, my friends will never love me like youGive me love like her,\\\\n\\\\\\'Cause lately

her brother played the guitar\\\\nShe asked me what does it mean the Gaelic ink on your arm?\\\\nSaid it was one of my friend\\'s songs do you want to drink on?\\\\nShe took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun\\\\nShe got Arthur on the table, with Johnny riding as a shotgun\\\\nChilled some more one more drink at the bar\\\\nThen say I\\'m on the jukebox, got to dance, you know\\\\n\\\\nShe

Galway Girl\\\\nYou\\'re my pretty little Galway Girl\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYou know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool\\\\nAnd then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room\\\\nAs last orders were called was when she stood on the stool\\\\nAfter dancing to Cèilidh singing to trad tunes\\\\nI never heard Carrickfergus ever sing so sweet\\\\nA capella in the bar wring her feet for the beat\\\\nOh, I could have that while playing on repeat for a week\\\\nAnd in this packed out room swear she was singing to me\\\\n\\\\nShe played the fiddle in an Irish

filled with fire and smoke\\\\nKeep watching over Durin\\'s son\\\\n\\\\nIf this is to end in fire\\\\nThen we should all burn together\\\\nWatch the flames climb high into the night\\\\nCalling out father, stand by and we will\\\\nWatch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side\\\\n\\\\nAnd if we should die tonight\\\\nThen we should all die together\\\\nRaise a glass of wine for the last time\\\\nCalling out father, prepare as we will\\\\nWatch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side\\\\nDesolation comes upon the sky\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNow I see fire, inside the mountain\\\\nI see fire, burning the trees\\\\nAnd I see fire, hollowing souls\\\\nI see fire, blood in the breeze\\\\nAnd I hope that you\\'ll remember me\\\\n\\\\nOh, should my people fall\\\\nThen

into this lonely town\\\\nAnd with that shadow upon the ground\\\\nI hear my people screaming out\\\\n\\\\nNow I see fire, inside the mountain\\\\nI see fire, burning the trees\\\\nI see fire, hollowing souls\\\\nI see fire, blood in the breeze\\\\n\\\\nI see fire, oh you know I saw a city burning (fire)\\\\nI see fire, feel the heat upon my skin (fire)\\\\nAnd I see fire (fire)\\\\nAnd I see fire burn auburn on the mountain sideOoh I’m a mess right now\\\\nInside out\\\\nSearching for a sweet surrender\\\\nBut this is not the end\\\\nI can’t work it out\\\\nHow?\\\\nGoing through the motions\\\\nGoing through us\\\\nAnd though I\\'ve known it for the longest time\\\\nAnd all my hope\\\\nAll my words are all over written on the signs\\\\nBut you’re my road walking me home\\\\nHome,

stomach\\\\n\\\\nI messed up this time\\\\nLate last night\\\\nDrinking to suppress devotion\\\\nWith fingers intertwined\\\\nI can’t shake this feeling now\\\\nWe’re going through the motions\\\\nHoping you\\'d stop\\\\nAnd though I’ve only caused you pain\\\\nYou know with all of my words\\\\nWith all this beloved\\\\nAlthough all the lies spoke\\\\nWhen you’re my road walking me home\\\\nHome, home, home\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSee the flames inside my eyes\\\\nIt burns so bright I wanna feel your love\\\\nEasy baby maybe I’m a light\\\\nBefore tonight I wanna fall in

sins of my father\\\\nWeigh down in my soul\\\\nAnd the pain of my mother\\\\nWill not let me go\\\\nWell I know there can come fire from the sky\\\\nTo refine the purest of kings\\\\nEven though\\\\nI know this fire brings me pain\\\\nEven so\\\\nI\\'m just the same\\\\n\\\\nMake it rain\\\\nMake it rain down low\\\\nJust make it rain\\\\nMake it rain\\\\nMake it rain\\\\nMake it rain down low\\\\nJust make it rain\\\\nMake it rain\\\\n\\\\nAnd the seed needs the water\\\\nBefore it grows out of the ground\\\\nBut it just keeps on getting hotter\\\\nAnd the hunger more profound\\\\nWell I know there can come tears from their eyes\\\\nBut they may as well be in vain\\\\nEven though\\\\nI know these tears bring me pain\\\\nEven so\\\\nI\\'m just the same\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMake it rain\\\\nMake it rain down low\\\\nJust make it rain\\\\nMake it rain\\\\nMake it rain\\\\nMake it rain down low\\\\nJust make it rain\\\\nMake it

with thunderous applause\\\\nAnd let the lightning be the veins\\\\nAnd fill the sky\\\\nWith all that they can drop\\\\nWhen it\\'s time\\\\nTo make a changeI was twenty-four years old when I met the woman I would call my own\\\\nTwenty two grand kids now growing old in that house that your brother bought ya\\\\nOh the summer day when I proposed, I made that wedding ring from [?] gold\\\\nAnd I asked her father, but her daddy said, \"No, you won\\\\\\'t marry my daughter\"\\\\n\\\\nShe and I went on the run\\\\nDon\\\\\\'t care about religion\\\\nI\\\\\\'m gonna marry the woman I love\\\\nDown by the wexford border\\\\nShe was Nancy Mulligan, and I was William Sheeran\\\\nShe took my name and then we were one\\\\nDown by the wexford border\\\\n\\\\nWill I met her at [Guy\\\\\\'s?] in the second world war\\\\nShe was working on a soldier\\\\\\'s ward\\\\nNever had I seen such beauty before\\\\nThe second that I saw her\\\\nNancy was my yellow rose\\\\nAnd we got married wearing borrowed clothes\\\\nWe got eight children now growing old\\\\nFive sons and three daughters\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShe and I went on the run\\\\nDon\\\\\\'t care about religion\\\\nI\\\\\\'m gonna marry the woman I love\\\\nDown by the wexford border\\\\nShe was Nancy Mulligan, and I was William Sheeran\\\\nShe took my name and then we were one\\\\nDown by the wexford border\\\\n\\\\nFrom her snow white in her [?] and jet black hair\\\\nOver sixty years I\\\\\\'ve been loving her\\\\nNow we\\\\\\'re sat by the fire in our old armchairs\\\\nYou know Nancy I adore ya\\\\nFrom a farm boy born near Belfast town\\\\nI never worried about the king and crown\\\\n\\\\\\'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground\\\\nThat\\\\\\'s the difference, I \\\\xa0assure ya\\\\n\\\\nShe and I went on the run\\\\nDon\\\\\\'t care about religion\\\\nI\\\\\\'m gonna marry the woman I love\\\\nDown by the wexford border\\\\nShe was Nancy Mulligan, and I was William Sheeran\\\\nShe took my name and then we were one\\\\nDown by the wexford borderI met you when I was a teen\\\\nBut then you were one as well\\\\nAnd I could play the guitar\\\\nJust like ringing a bell\\\\nSometimes I wonder\\\\nAnd any other summer could you have been my part time lover\\\\nTo me listening to Stevie Wonder\\\\nUnder the covers where we used to lay\\\\nAnd Re: Stacks is what the speakers play\\\\nI’ll be on tour almost every day\\\\nWhen I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay\\\\nJust watching the DVD, smoking illegal weed\\\\nGetting high as two kites, we needed no breathe\\\\nWe used each others edge just for the people to see\\\\nAnd stay up all night like when we needed to sleep\\\\nWe go anywhere, our minds would take us\\\\nAnd also you are beautiful without your make-up\\\\nAnd you don’t even need to worry about your weight cause\\\\nWe can all be loved the way God made us\\\\nAnd time’s the only reason that we could break up\\\\nCause you would always tell me I\\'m away too much\\\\nDistance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane\\\\nOr make a mistake, say it again\\\\n\\\\nOh Nina\\\\nYou should go Nina\\\\n‘Cause I ain’t ever coming home\\\\nNina, oh, won’t you leave me now\\\\nAnd I’ve been living on the road Nina\\\\nBut then again you should know Nina\\\\nCause that’s you and me both\\\\nNina, oh, won’t you leave me now\\\\nNow\\\\n\\\\nAnd every weekend in the winter\\\\nYou’d be wearing my hoodie\\\\nWith draw strings pulled tight\\\\nTo keep your face from the cold\\\\nTaking day trips to the local\\\\nWhere we be on the road\\\\nCause every day when I was away\\\\nWe\\'d only speak on the phone\\\\nWatching Blue Planet\\\\nCreating new habits\\\\nActing as if we were two rabbits\\\\nAnd then you\\'d vanish\\\\nBack to the borrow with all the Celtics\\\\nI disappear\\\\nYou call me selfish, I understand\\\\nBut I can’t help it\\\\nI put my job over everything\\\\nExcept my family and friends\\\\nBut you’ll be in between forever\\\\nSo I guess we’ll have to take a step back\\\\nOverlook the situation\\\\nCause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications\\\\nAnd I’m not saying we should be taking a break\\\\nJust re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late\\\\nSo we kinda need to deal with the pain\\\\nOr wait to get on the plane\\\\nBut in the day we’ll have to say it again\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOh Nina\\\\nYou should go Nina\\\\n‘Cause I ain’t ever coming home\\\\nNina, oh, won’t you leave me now\\\\nAnd I’ve been living on the road Nina\\\\nBut then again you should know Nina\\\\nCause that’s you and me both\\\\nNina, oh, won’t you leave me now\\\\nNow\\\\n\\\\nLove will come and love will go\\\\nBut you can make it on your own\\\\nSing that song, go, oh won’t you leave me now\\\\nPeople grow, and fall apart\\\\nBut you can mend your broken heart\\\\nTake it back, oh oh won’t you leave me now\\\\n\\\\nOh Nina\\\\nYou should go Nina\\\\n‘Cause I ain’t ever coming home\\\\nNina, oh, won’t you leave me now\\\\nAnd I’ve been living on the road Nina\\\\nBut then again you should know Nina\\\\nCause that’s you and me both\\\\nNina, oh, won’t you leave me now\\\\nNowNo, no, no, no, no\\\\n\\\\nI heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans\\\\nGoes to the gym at least six times a week\\\\nWears both shoes with no socks on his feet\\\\nAnd I hear he\\\\\\'s on a new diet at watches what he eats\\\\nHe\\\\\\'s got his eyebrows plucked and his asshole bleached\\\\nOwns every single Ministry CD\\\\nTribal tattoos

bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse\\\\nEvery year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas\\\\nDrinks beer, but has a six pack, I\\\\\\'m kinda jealous\\\\nHe wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime\\\\nAnd every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gang sign\\\\nSays, \"Cheya!\", boy never light up the room\\\\nBut enough about him, girl, let\\\\\\'s talk about you\\\\nYou were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin\\\\\\'\\\\nEatin\\\\\\' a packet of crisp, but you will never find you cheatin\\\\\\'\\\\nNow you\\\\\\'re eatin\\\\\\' kale, hittin\\\\\\' the gym\\\\nKeepin\\\\\\' up with Kylie and Kim\\\\nIn the back of the club, kissin\\\\\\' a boy that ain\\\\\\'t him\\\\nOkay, you need to be alone\\\\nAnd if you wanna talk about it, you can call my

girl, I\\'ll be your man\\\\nI see my future in your eyes\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBaby, I\\'m dancing in the dark, with you between my arms\\\\nBarefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song\\\\nWhen I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful\\\\nI don\\'t deserve this, darling you look perfect tonight\\\\n\\\\nBaby, I\\'m dancing in the dark, with you between my arms\\\\nBarefoot

knows\\\\nI’ll just runaway and be on my own.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI’ve never seen my dad cry\\\\nCold as stone in the kitchen light\\\\nI tell you it\\'s about time\\\\nBut I was raised to

shoelaces, and hope that\\\\nThings change, but for now I leave town with a backpack on my shoulder\\\\n\\\\nBut I love him from the skin to my bones\\\\nBut I don’t wanna live in his home\\\\nThere’s

got nothing to say and nothing to know\\\\nBut something to drink and maybe something to smoke\\\\nLet it go until I wrote a change singing we found love in a local rave\\\\nI don’t really know what I’m supposed to say\\\\nBut I can just figure it out and hope and pray\\\\nI told her my name and said it’s nice to meet ya\\\\nAnd then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila\\\\nI already know she’s a keeper\\\\nJust from this one small act of kindness, I’m in deep\\\\nIf anybody finds out I’m meant to drive home\\\\nBut I drunk all of it now, no\\\\nSobering up\\\\nWe just sit on the couch one thing led to another\\\\nNow she’s kissing my mouth\\\\n\\\\nI need you darling, Come on set the tone\\\\nIf you feel you’re falling, Won’t you let me know\\\\nIf you love me come on get involved\\\\nFeel it rushing through you from your head to toe\\\\n\\\\nSing\\\\nLouder\\\\nSing\\\\n\\\\nCan you feel it?\\\\nAll the guys in here don’t even wanna dance\\\\nCan you feel

it?\\\\n\\\\nI need you darling\\\\nCome on set the tone\\\\nIf you feel you’re falling\\\\nWon’t you let me know\\\\nIf you love me come on get involved\\\\nFeel it rushing through you  from your head to toeI gave all my oxygen to people that could breath\\\\nI gave many my money and now we don\\'t even speak\\\\nI drive miles and miles but would you do the same for me\\\\nOh, honestly?\\\\nOffered up my shoulder just for you to cry upon\\\\xa0\\\\nGave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm\\\\nThey gave me the heartache and in return I gave a wing\\\\nIts goes on and on and on\\\\n\\\\nLife can get you down so I just numb the way it feels\\\\nI drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills\\\\nAnd all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf, my farewell\\\\nSo before I save someone else, I\\'ve got to save myself\\\\n\\\\nI gave you all my energy and I took away your pain\\\\n\\'Cause human beings are destined to [?] or drink\\\\nWhat time do we stand upon come have it looks the same?\\\\nAnd only scars remain\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLife can get you down so I just numb the way it feels\\\\nI drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills\\\\nAnd all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf my farewell\\\\nSo before I save someone else, I\\'ve got to save myself\\\\n\\\\nBut if don\\'t then I\\'ll go back to where I\\'m becoming a stranger\\\\nJust because they ended being just like that\\\\nOh, I\\'m here again between the devil and the danger\\\\nBut I guess it\\'s hust of nature\\\\nMy dad was wrong \\'cause I\\'m not like my mum\\\\n\\'Cause she\\'d just smile and I\\'m complaining in a song, but it helps\\\\nSo before I save someone else, I\\'ve got to save myself\\\\n\\\\nLife can get you down so I just numb the way it feels\\\\nI drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills\\\\nAnd all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf, my farewell\\\\nSo before I save someone else, I\\'ve got to save myself\\\\nAnd before I blame someone else, I\\'ve got to save myself\\\\nAnd before I love someone else, I\\'ve got to love myselfI took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill\\\\nI threw the day old tea from the cup\\\\nPacked\\\\xa0up the photo album Matthew had made\\\\nMemories of a life that\\\\\\'s been loved\\\\nTook the get well soon cards and stuffed animals\\\\nPoured the old ginger been down the sink\\\\nDad always told me, \"Don\\\\\\'t you cry when you\\\\\\'re down\"\\\\nBut mum, there\\\\\\'s a tear every time that I blink\\\\n\\\\nOh I\\\\\\'m in pieces, it\\\\\\'s tearing me up, but I know\\\\nA heart that\\\\\\'s broke is a heart that\\\\\\'s been loved\\\\n\\\\nSo I\\\\\\'ll sing Hallelujah\\\\nYou were an angel in the shape of my mum\\\\nWhen I fell down you\\\\\\'d be there holding me up\\\\nSpread your wings as you go\\\\nAnd when God takes you back we\\\\\\'ll say Hallelujah\\\\nYou\\\\\\'re home\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up\\\\nFolded your nightgowns neatly in a case\\\\nJohn says he\\\\\\'d drive then put his hand on my cheek\\\\nAnd wiped a tear from the side of my face\\\\n\\\\nI hope that I see the world as you did cause I know\\\\nA life with love is a life that\\\\\\'s been lived\\\\n\\\\nSo I\\\\\\'ll sing Hallelujah\\\\nYou were an angel in the shape of my mum\\\\nWhen I fell down you\\\\\\'d be there holding me up\\\\nSpread your wings as you go\\\\nAnd when God takes you back we\\\\\\'ll say Hallelujah\\\\nYou\\\\\\'re home\\\\nHallelujah\\\\nYou were an angel in the shape of my mum\\\\nYou got to see the person I have become\\\\nSpread your wings and I\\\\\\'ll know that\\\\nWhen God took you back he said Hallelujah\\\\nYou\\\\\\'re home...I woke up early looking out my window\\\\nAt the Amsterdam sky\\\\nOh baby I was high last night\\\\nCafe clouds and red lights\\\\nWhen I gotcha in mind\\\\nYou slowed down time\\\\nOh baby I was out of my mind\\\\nSing a song cover and hold me tight\\\\n\\\\nI drill you deep into my chest\\\\nThat’s where it feels the best\\\\nYou can remove all the scars\\\\nStop them from breaking my heart\\\\nBeen on a hurting spree\\\\nThat brought out the worst in me\\\\n‘cause I don’t want to be alone\\\\n\\\\n‘cause everyday that I’m breathing I think you are the one\\\\nI love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue\\\\nFeel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs\\\\nSweet Mary Jane won’t you sing another song\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCafé clouds and shooting stars are floating across the sky\\\\nOh baby what a beautiful sight\\\\nBut we’re only satellites\\\\nOh di ba di ba oh la lights\\\\nOh baby I am so damn high\\\\nHave you seen my eyes\\\\n\\\\nWith the beat beat of my heart\\\\nYou take me back to the start\\\\nWhere everything began\\\\nHolding you inside my hands\\\\nBetween my fingers and thumb\\\\nI seal you in with my tongue,\\\\n‘Cause I don’t want to be alone\\\\n\\\\n‘Cause everyday that I’m breathing I think you are the one\\\\nI love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue\\\\nFeel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs\\\\nSweet Mary Jane won’t you me sing another song\\\\n\\\\nNa na na na na Sweet Mary Jane\\\\nNa na na na na Sweet Mary Jane\\\\nNa na na na na Sweet Mary Jane\\\\nNa na na na na Sing another song\\\\n\\\\nMary Jane,\\\\nI’ve been hoping alone\\\\nMary Jane,\\\\nSince you came along\\\\nMary Jane,\\\\nI’m almost home\\\\nMary Jane,\\\\nSing another song\\\\n\\\\n‘Cause everyday that I’m breathing I think you are the one\\\\nI love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue\\\\nFeel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs\\\\nSweet Mary Jane won’t you me sing another song\\\\n\\\\n‘Cause everyday that I’m breathing, sweet Mary Jane\\\\nI love the sound of your sweet words, sweet Mary Jane\\\\nFeel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs\\\\nSweet Mary Jane won’t you sing me another songI can taste salt water\\\\nAnd if I blink again\\\\nYou’ll be sinking in\\\\nSo we’ll learn to swim in the ocean\\\\nYou made to hold ya\\\\nAnd you think of him\\\\nAnd pretty soon you’ll be floating away\\\\nAnd I’ll hold on to the words you spoke of\\\\nAnchored down in my throat, love\\\\nAnd I’m captain of this sinking boat, now\\\\nWe just want all men to carry me home\\\\nThe salted tears won’t dry\\\\nI’ll wipe my shirtsleeves\\\\nUnder your eyes\\\\nThese hearts will be flooded tonight\\\\nI’ll wipe my shirtsleeves\\\\nUnder your eyes\\\\nYour eyes, your eyes, your eyes,your eyes\\\\n\\\\nI still taste salt water\\\\nOn my lips from your kiss bitterness\\\\nAnd I drown within the ocean you made\\\\nAnd I hate to love you, these cuffs cover in your make up\\\\nI’ll never trust you again\\\\nYou can just be a friend\\\\nAnd I’ll hold on to the words you spoke of\\\\nAnchored down in my throat, love\\\\nAnd I’m captain of this sinking boat, now\\\\nWe just want all men to carry me home\\\\nThe salted tears won’t dry\\\\nI’ll wipe my shirtsleeves\\\\nUnder your eyes\\\\nThese hearts will be flooded tonight\\\\nI’ll wipe my shirtsleeves\\\\nUnder your eyes\\\\nYour eyes, your lips, your mouth\\\\nYour thighs, your back, you drive me wild\\\\nTonight, the fact design\\\\nI’m on my way home\\\\nOn the way home\\\\nI lied, I tried to cry but I’m drowning in the ocean you made\\\\n\\\\nThe salted tears won’t dry\\\\nI’ll wipe my shirtsleeves\\\\nUnder your eyes\\\\nThese hearts will be flooded tonight\\\\nI’ll wipe my shirtsleeves\\\\nUnder your eyes\\\\nYour eyes, your eyes, you eyesYou\\'re just a small bump unborn, in four months you\\'re brought to life,\\\\nYou might be left with my hair, but you\\'ll have your mother\\'s eyes,\\\\nI\\'ll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can, but for now your scan of my unmade plans,\\\\nA small bump in four months, you\\'re brought to life\\\\n\\\\nI\\'ll whisper quietly, and give you nothing but truth,\\\\nIf you\\'re not inside me, I\\'ll put my future in you\\\\n\\\\nYou are my one and only.\\\\nYou can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.\\\\nOh, you are my one and only.\\\\nYou can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.\\\\nAnd you\\'ll be alright.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYou\\'re just a small bump unknown, you\\'ll grow into your skin.\\\\nWith a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin.\\\\nFinger nails the size of a half grain of rice,\\\\nAnd eyelids closed to be soon opened wide\\\\nA small bump, in four months you\\'ll open your eyes.\\\\n\\\\nAnd I\\'ll hold you tightly, and give you nothing but truth,\\\\nIf you\\'re not inside me, I\\'ll put my future in you\\\\n\\\\nYou are my one and only.\\\\nYou can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.\\\\nOh, you are my one and only.\\\\nYou can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.\\\\nAnd you\\'ll be alright.\\\\n\\\\nYou can lie with me,\\\\nWith your tiny feet\\\\nWhen you\\'re half asleep,\\\\nI\\'ll leave you be.\\\\nRight in front of me\\\\nFor a couple weeks\\\\nSo I can keep you safe.\\\\n\\\\n\\'Cause you are my one and only.\\\\nYou can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.\\\\nYou are my one and only.\\\\nYou can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.\\\\nAnd you\\'ll be alright.\\\\n\\\\nYou were just a small bump unborn for four months then torn from life.\\\\nMaybe you were needed up there but we\\'re still unaware as why.When your legs don\\'t work like they used to before\\\\nAnd I can\\'t sweep you off of your feet\\\\nWill your mouth still remember the taste of my love?\\\\nWill your eyes still smile from your cheeks?\\\\n\\\\nAnd darling I will be loving you \\'til we\\'re 70\\\\nAnd baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23\\\\nAnd I\\'m thinking \\'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways\\\\nMaybe just the touch of a hand\\\\nWell, me I fall in love with you every single day\\\\nAnd I just wanna tell you I am\\\\nSo honey now\\\\nTake me into your loving arms\\\\nKiss me under the light of a thousand stars\\\\nPlace your head on my beating heart\\\\nI\\'m thinking out loud\\\\nThat maybe we found love right where we are\\\\n\\\\nWhen my hair\\'s all but gone and my memory fades\\\\nAnd the crowds don\\'t remember my name\\\\nWhen my hands don\\'t play the strings the same way\\\\nI know you will still love me the same\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\'Cause honey your soul could never grow old, it\\'s evergreen\\\\nAnd baby your smile\\'s forever in my mind and memory\\\\nI\\'m thinking \\'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways\\\\nMaybe it\\'s all part of a plan\\\\nWell, I\\'ll just keep on making the same mistakes\\\\nHoping that you\\'ll understand\\\\nBut baby now\\\\n\\\\nTake me into your loving arms\\\\nKiss me under the light of a thousand stars\\\\nPlace your head on my beating heart\\\\nThinking out loud\\\\nThat maybe we found love right where we are\\\\n\\\\nSo baby now\\\\nTake me into your loving arms\\\\nKiss me under the light of a thousand stars\\\\nOh darling, place your head on my beating heart\\\\nI\\'m thinking out loud\\\\nThat maybe we found love right where we are\\\\nOh baby we found love right where we are\\\\n\\\\nAnd we found love right where we areWhite lips, pale face\\\\nBreathing in snowflakes\\\\nBurnt lungs, sour taste\\\\nLight\\'s gone, day\\'s end\\\\nStruggling to pay rent\\\\nLong nights, strange men\\\\n\\\\nAnd they say\\\\nShe\\'s in the Class A Team\\\\nStuck in her daydream\\\\nBeen this way since 18\\\\nBut lately her face seems\\\\nSlowly sinking, wasting\\\\nCrumbling like pastries\\\\nAnd they scream\\\\nThe worst things in life come free to us\\\\nCos we\\'re just under the upperhand\\\\nAnd go mad for a couple of grams\\\\nAnd she don\\'t want to go outside tonight\\\\nAnd in a pipe she flies to the Motherland\\\\nOr sells love to another man\\\\nIt\\'s too cold outside\\\\nFor angels to fly\\\\nAngels to fly\\\\n\\\\nRipped gloves, raincoat\\\\nTried to swim and stay afloat\\\\nDry house, wet clothes\\\\nLoose change, bank notes\\\\nWeary-eyed, dry throat\\\\nCool girl, no phone\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAnd they say\\\\nShe\\'s in the Class A Team\\\\nStuck in her daydream\\\\nBeen this way since 18\\\\nBut lately her face seems\\\\nSlowly sinking, wasting\\\\nCrumbling like pastries\\\\nAnd they scream\\\\nThe worst things in life come free to us\\\\nCos we\\'re just under the upperhand\\\\nAnd go mad for a couple of grams\\\\nAnd she don\\'t want to go outside tonight\\\\nAnd in a pipe she flies to the Motherland\\\\nOr sells love to another man\\\\nIt\\'s too cold outside\\\\nFor angels to fly\\\\nAngels to fly\\\\n\\\\nAnd they

with a flow\\\\nI\\'ve got a habit of spitting\\\\nQuicker lyrics you know\\\\nYou found me ripping the writtens\\\\nOut of the pages they sit in\\\\nAnd never once I get bitten,\\\\nBecause plagiarism is hidden\\\\nWhich I would sit on the rhythm,\\\\nPrisoner with a vision\\\\n\\\\nSigned to a label, but didn\\'t listen to any criticism\\\\nThought you knew but you didn\\'t\\\\nSo perk your ears up and listen\\\\nStudio with a system\\\\nAnd you could say that I\\'m driven\\\\nAnd now it\\'s on to the next saga\\\\nWe drink the best lager\\\\nI never tried to win you\\\\nOver like your stepfather\\\\nI do my own thing now, and get respect after\\\\nAnd I\\'m avoiding the cane like it was Get Carter\\\\n\\\\nFor four years I never had a place to stay\\\\nBut it\\'s safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight\\\\nAt 16 years old I moved out of my home\\\\nI was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and\\\\nI choked\\\\nAnd we\\'ve been sleeping at the subway station, sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population\\\\nNot my imagination, I don\\'t want to relax\\\\nBut would it hurt your reputation,\\\\nIf I put it on wax?\\\\nI take it back now\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n[chorus]\\\\nCome on and take it back love\\\\nCome on and take it back for us\\\\nDon\\'t you fade into the back love, oh\\\\n\\\\nTake it back with the rhythm and blues\\\\nAnd my back pack I\\'ll be singing the news,\\\\nTrying to act like Jack Black when I bring him to school\\\\nI\\'ll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop,\\\\nBringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes,\\\\nI give you the truth through the vocal booth,\\\\nStars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit,\\\\nThey try and take aim like beckham when he goes to shoot,\\\\nBut then again that\\'s what they\\'re supposed to do,\\\\nAnd I\\'m supposed to be calm,\\\\nI tattooed the lyrics onto my arm, whispering everything that happens is from now on,\\\\nI\\'ll be ready to start it again at the end of the song,\\\\nStill they claiming that I handled it wrong,\\\\nBut then I never had an enemy, except for NME,\\\\nBut I\\'ll be selling twice as many copies as the magazines will ever be,\\\\nWith only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees,\\\\nAre healthier than a dalmatian with pedigree\\\\nSinging for the masses,\\\\nRubber dinghy rapids,\\\\nKeep this rapping a habit\\\\nAnd keep on fashioning magic,\\\\nI\\'m battling with respect,\\\\nI don\\'t know if I\\'ll have it,\\\\nThis songs from the heart,\\\\nCovering the planet,\\\\nI\\'ll take it back now\\\\n\\\\n[chorus]\\\\nCome on and take it back love\\\\nCome on and take it back for us\\\\nDon\\'t you fade into the back love, oh\\\\n\\\\nTake it back now\\\\nNow, I don\\'t ever want to be perfect,\\\\nCause I\\'m a singer that you\\\\nNever want to see shirtless\\\\nI accept the fact that someone\\'s got to win the worst-dressed,\\\\nTaking my first steps into the scene,\\\\nGiving me focus\\\\nPutting on a brave face, like Timothy Dalton\\\\nConsidering a name change,\\\\nThinking it was hopeless\\\\nRhyming over recordings\\\\nAvoiding tradition\\\\nCause every day some lyrics\\\\nAnd a melody can be written\\\\nNow absence can make your heart ache\\\\nBut drinking absinthe can change your mind-state, vividly,\\\\nI need to let my liver be\\\\nAnd I say it again,\\\\nLiving life on the edge,\\\\nWith a closed hand full of friends\\\\nIs good advice from a man\\\\nWho took his life on the road with me\\\\nAnd I hope to see him blowing up globally\\\\nCause that\\'s how it\\'s supposed to be\\\\nI\\'m screaming out vocally\\\\nMight seem totally impossible\\\\nAchieving life\\'s dreams\\\\nBut, but I just write schemes\\\\nI\\'m never having a stylist, giving me tight jeans\\\\nMadison Square Garden is where I might be\\\\nBut more likely,\\\\nYou\\'ll find me in the back\\\\nRoom of a dive bar with my mates\\\\nHaving a pint with McDaid\\\\nDiscussing records we made\\\\nAnd every single second knowing\\\\nThat we\\'ll never betray\\\\nThe way we were raised\\\\nRemembering our background\\\\nSat down\\\\nThat\\'s how we plan it out;\\\\nIt\\'s time to take it back now\\\\n\\\\n[chorus]\\\\nCome on and take it back love\\\\nCome on and take it back for us\\\\nDon\\'t you fade into the back love, oh\\\\n\\\\nCome on and take it back love\\\\nCome on and take it back for us\\\\nDon\\'t you fade into the back love, oh\\\\n\\\\nMy dreams keep me awake at night\\\\nWritten in rhymes, and lies, deliver the hype\\\\nAm I just living the lie\\\\nWith this you must know that the number\\'s just sold woah\\\\nWill keep me going through the tough times, dream with me\\\\nWe forget 90 per cent of it when we wake\\\\nBut the other 10 per cent it never fades\\\\nDreaming dreams, day to day goals\\\\nStay awake loads, try to make the cut like the\\\\nPaper or razor blade, oh, never give up\\\\nAnd just remember just to hold out more\\\\nA couple years ago\\\\nI couldn\\'t just control that thought\\\\nYou\\'d find me buskin\\' on the street\\\\nWhen it was cold outdoors\\\\nAnd now I\\'m sweating on the stage\\\\nOf a sold out tour\\\\nWriting love songs for the sake of it\\\\nNever to make a hit\\\\nYou can\\'t fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick\\\\nI\\'m not a rapper I\\'m a singer, I just take the piss and\\\\nMost of these other guys are kids that posties\\\\nLittle sister has to babysit, that\\'s just a way it is\\\\nDreams are your own, just set your goals\\\\nAnd have the utmost faith in it; tread your own path\\\\nYou\\'ll never make it as a follower, you\\'ll never know\\\\nWhere you will go or where you will be tomorrowYou look so wonderful in your dress\\\\nI love your hair like that\\\\nThe way it falls on the side of your neck\\\\nDown your shoulders and back\\\\n\\\\nWe are surrounded by all of these lights\\\\nAnd people who talk too much\\\\nYou\\'ve got that kind of look in your eyes\\\\nAs if no one knows anything but us\\\\n\\\\nAnd should this be the last thing I see\\\\nI want you to know it\\'s enough for me\\\\nCause all that you are is all that I\\'ll ever need\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI\\'m so in love, so in love\\\\nSo in love, so in love\\\\n\\\\nYou look so beautiful in this light\\\\nYour silhouette over me\\\\nThe way it brings out the blue in your eyes\\\\nIs the Tenerife sea\\\\n\\\\nAnd all of the voices surrounding us here\\\\nThey just fade out when you take a breath\\\\nJust say the word and I will disappear\\\\nInto the wilderness\\\\n\\\\nAnd should this be the last thing I see\\\\nI want you to know it\\'s enough for me\\\\nCause all that you are is all that I\\'ll ever need\\\\n\\\\nI\\'m so in love, so in love\\\\nSo in love, so in love\\\\n\\\\nLumiere, darling\\\\nLumiere over me [x6]\\\\n\\\\nAnd should this be the last thing I see\\\\nI want you to know it\\'s enough for me\\\\nCause all that you are is all that I\\'ll ever need\\\\n\\\\nI\\'m so in love, so in love\\\\nSo in love, love, love, love,\\\\nSo in love\\\\n\\\\nYou look so wonderful in your dress\\\\nI loved your hair like that\\\\nAnd in the moment I knew you bestNow I don\\'t wanna hate you\\\\nJust wish you\\'d never gone for the man\\\\nAnd waited two weeks at least\\\\nBefore you let him take you\\\\nI stayed true\\\\nI kind of knew you liked the dude from private school\\\\nHe\\'s waiting for the time to move\\\\nI knew he had his eyes on you\\\\nHe\\'s not the right guy for you\\\\nDon\\'t hate me cause I write the truth\\\\nNo I would never lie to you\\\\nBut it was never fine to lose you\\\\nAnd what a way to find out\\\\nIt never came from my mouth\\\\nYou never changed your mind\\\\nBut you were just afraid to mind out\\\\nBut f- it, I won\\'t be changing the subject I love it\\\\nI\\'ll make your little secret public it\\'s nothing\\\\nI\\'m just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet to get back at me\\\\nTrapped and I\\'m lacking sleep\\\\nFact is you\\'re mad at me because I backtrack so casually\\\\nYou\\'re practically my family\\\\nIf we married then I\\'ll guess you\\'d have to be\\\\nBut tragically our love just lost the will to live\\\\nBut would I kill to give it one more shot\\\\nI think not\\\\n\\\\n[Hook]\\\\nI don\\'t love you baby\\\\nI don\\'t need you baby\\\\nI don\\'t want you no\\\\nAnymore\\\\nI don\\'t love you baby\\\\nI don\\'t need you baby\\\\nI don\\'t wanna love you no\\\\nAnymore\\\\n\\\\nRecently I tend to zone out\\\\nUp in my headphones to Holocene\\\\nYou promised your body but I\\'m away so much\\\\nI stay more celibate than in a monastery\\\\nI\\'m not cut out for life on the road\\\\nCause I didn\\'t know I\\'d miss you this much\\\\nAnd at the time we\\'d just go, so sue me\\\\nI guess I\\'m not the man that you need\\\\nEver since you went to uni\\\\nI\\'ve been sofa surfing with a rucksack\\\\nFull of less cash and I guess that could get bad\\\\nBut when I broke the industry\\\\nThat\\'s when I broke your heart\\\\nI was supposed to chart and celebrate\\\\nBut good things are over fast\\\\nI know it\\'s hard to deal with and see this\\\\nI tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features\\\\nThen I turn the music off\\\\nAnd all I\\'m left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus\\\\nI never really want to believe this\\\\nGot advice from my dad and he\\\\nTold me that family is all I\\'ll ever have and need\\\\nI guess I\\'m unaware of it\\\\nSuccess is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI don\\'t love you baby\\\\nI don\\'t need you baby\\\\nI don\\'t want you no\\\\nAnymore\\\\nI don\\'t love you baby\\\\nI don\\'t need you baby\\\\nI don\\'t wanna love you no\\\\nAnymore\\\\n\\\\nAnd since you left, I\\'ve given up my days off\\\\nIt\\'s what I need to stay strong\\\\nI know you have a day job but mine is 24/7\\\\nI feel like writing a book, I guess I lied in the hook\\\\nCause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could\\\\nThe irony is if my career and music didn\\'t exist\\\\nIn 6 years, yeah, you\\'d probably be my wife with a kid\\\\nI\\'m frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink\\\\nAnd lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it\\'s\\\\nJust hiding my misguiding thoughts that I\\'m trying to kill\\\\nAnd I\\'d be writing my will before I\\'m 27, I\\'ll die from a thrill\\\\nGo down in history as just a wasted talent\\\\nCan I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing?\\\\nIt\\'s only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me\\\\nEventually I\\'ll be fine I know that it was never meant to be\\\\nEither way I guess I\\'m not prepared, but I\\'ll say this\\\\nThese things happen for a reason and you can\\'t change shit\\\\nTake my apology, I\\'m sorry for the honesty\\\\nBut I had to get this off my chest\\\\n\\\\nI don\\'t love you baby\\\\nI don\\'t need you baby\\\\nI don\\'t want you no\\\\nAnymore\\\\nI don\\'t love you baby\\\\nI don\\'t need you baby\\\\nI don\\'t wanna love you no\\\\nAnymoreAin\\\\\\'t got a soapbox I can stand upon\\\\nBut God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song\\\\nMy daddy told me, \"Son, don\\\\\\'t you get involved in\\\\nPolitics, religions or other people\\\\\\'s quotes\"\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'ll paint the picture, let me set the scene\\\\nI know when I have children they will know what it means\\\\nAnd I pass on these things my family\\\\\\'s given to me\\\\nJust love and understanding, positivity\\\\n\\\\nWe could change this whole world with a piano\\\\nAdd a bass, some guitar, grab a beat\\\\nAnd away we go\\\\nI\\\\\\'m just a boy with a one-man show\\\\nNo university, no degree\\\\nBut lord knows everybody\\\\\\'s talking \\\\\\'bout exponential growth\\\\nAnd the star monkey crashing in their portfolios\\\\nWhile I\\\\\\'ll be sitting here with a song I wrote\\\\nSing, love could change the world in a moment\\\\nBut what do I know?\\\\nLove can change the world in a moment\\\\nBut what do I know?\\\\nLove can change the world in a moment\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe revolution\\\\\\'s coming, it\\\\\\'s a minute away\\\\nI saw people marching in the streets today\\\\nYou know we are made up of love and hate\\\\nBut both of them are balanced on a razor blade\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'ll paint the picture, let me set the scene\\\\nI know, I\\\\\\'m all for people following their dreams\\\\nJust re-remember life is more than fitten\\\\\\' in your jeans\\\\nIt\\\\\\'s love and understanding, positivity\\\\n\\\\nWe could change this whole world with a piano\\\\nAdd a bass, some guitar, grab a beat\\\\nAnd away we go\\\\nI\\\\\\'m just a boy with a one-man show\\\\nNo university, no degree\\\\nBut lord knows everybody\\\\\\'s talking \\\\\\'bout exponential growth\\\\nAnd the star monkey crashing in their portfolios\\\\nWhile I\\\\\\'ll be sitting here with a song I wrote\\\\nSing, love could change the world in a moment\\\\nBut what do I know?\\\\nLove can change the world in a moment\\\\nBut what do I know?\\\\nLove can change the world in a moment\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'ll paint the picture, let me set the scene\\\\nYou know, the future\\\\\\'s in the hands of you and me\\\\nSo let\\\\\\'s all get together, we can alle be free\\\\nSpread love and understanding, positivity\\\\n\\\\nWe could change this whole world with a piano\\\\nAdd a bass, some guitar, grab a beat\\\\nAnd away we go\\\\nI\\\\\\'m just a boy with a one-man show\\\\nNo university, no degree\\\\nBut lord knows everybody\\\\\\'s talking \\\\\\'bout exponential growth\\\\nAnd the star monkey crashing in their portfolios\\\\nWhile I\\\\\\'ll be sitting here with a song I wrote\\\\nSing, love could change the world in a moment\\\\nBut what do I know?\\\\nLove can change the world in a moment\\\\nBut what do
